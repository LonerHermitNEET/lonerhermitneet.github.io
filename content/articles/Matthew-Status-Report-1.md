# Matthew Status Report #1

Good evening, everyone. 

To start, the following images are the current stats with respect to the viewership decrease in the range between Chapter 1 and 2 and the range between Chapter 5 and 10 of the story currently titled "Matthew: The Epitome of Grace and Beauty - Intellectual LitRPG Isekai Novel". (This is subject to change.) 

Moreover, the first round of revisions starting from Chapter 1 to the current latest chapter is undergoing heavy consideration. 

In conclusion, this status report reveals a rejection of narrative shifts that occur primarily between chapter 5 and 10.    

Also, this status report, being the first one, represents an authorial transition toward transparency and communication moving forward.
