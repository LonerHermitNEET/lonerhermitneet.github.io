summary, but in reality, each person has many different aspects to their identity. When someone writes an introduction about a person, they struggle with how to represent the person&rsquo;s complexity from both the past and present. Most existing introductions provide a general overview of different parts of the person&rsquo;s life and try to treat all aspects equally. This approach is good because it tries to avoid favoring one aspect of the person over others or claiming to capture the person&rsquo;s true essence. However, the downside is that in a book with limited pages, there&rsquo;s a risk of covering a lot of topics superficially, becoming more like a list of facts than an in-depth understanding. This might leave readers finishing the book without really knowing much about the person. Still, I think it is worth trying anyway.</p><h2 id=the-day-of-righteousness>The Day of Righteousness
<a class=anchor href=#the-day-of-righteousness>#</a></h2><h3 id=in-nca>In NCA&mldr;
<a class=anchor href=#in-nca>#</a></h3><p>In NCA&mldr; I was very young. went to that school from 6 - 12 years old&mldr; probably.</p><h3 id=david-and-deomer>David and Deomer
<a class=anchor href=#david-and-deomer>#</a></h3><p>David and Deomer had a fight.
Isaiah was washing at the faucet.
The oldest student [Emmanuel] had this complex look on his face.
Kelsey was smiling.
Joecel was running.
Joecel&rsquo;s younger brother threw a rock at me.
I was running.
EK was there, smiling. I don&rsquo;t actually remember him unfortunately.
Joanna was being paired up with me as a school couple. Fair to say I wasn&rsquo;t the most amused, but I believe now I had this innate curiosity back then. I don&rsquo;t about Joanna though, but she had this resting frown that she probably deepened or relaxed.
I remember being excited that I was finally becoming sixth grade.</p><h3 id=ardys-observation>Ardy&rsquo;s Observation
<a class=anchor href=#ardys-observation>#</a></h3><p>I remember Ardy telling me that I smiled weirdly because I always hid my lips, compressing them.</p><h3 id=badjoys-question>Badjoy&rsquo;s Question
<a class=anchor href=#badjoys-question>#</a></h3><p>I remember years later that Badjoy would ask me about whether I liked Kelsey. I redirected his question to him, and I remember realizing that everyone probably liked Kelsey.</p><h3 id=memories-of-surroundings>Memories of Surroundings
<a class=anchor href=#memories-of-surroundings>#</a></h3><p>I remember the cement ground. It had a very thinly, regularly stepped, rugged, rippling pattern. I remember climbing the flag pole.</p><p>I remember seeing the water come out from the tubes that started at the roof of the church and ended below the cantilever.</p><p>I remember the plants. I remember the flowers Mom brought home and brought to Church.</p><h3 id=recollections-in-dads-room>Recollections in Dad&rsquo;s Room
<a class=anchor href=#recollections-in-dads-room>#</a></h3><p>I remember complaining about going to church in a large bed in my Dad&rsquo;s room in 501D beside my siblings lying down. It was bright and hot, and the door was open. I think I remember the laptop being there, but I&rsquo;m not sure.</p><h3 id=childhood-memories>Childhood Memories
<a class=anchor href=#childhood-memories>#</a></h3><p>I remember the sound of the white, wooden wall of Ate&rsquo;s room being very hollow and sensitive to making loud noises when hit. I would hear it often when I and my siblings slept there.</p><p>We don&rsquo;t sleep together on the same bed anymore.</p><h3 id=reflections-on-growth>Reflections on Growth
<a class=anchor href=#reflections-on-growth>#</a></h3><p>Many years later, probably 2020, I remember seeing the tall, black ceiling of the camp I was in at the beach side. I think it was cold. I remember seeing the flashlights dart past me from the entrance of the ceiling both in the early morning and in the night.</p><h3 id=impressions-of-others>Impressions of Others
<a class=anchor href=#impressions-of-others>#</a></h3><p>I remember seeing the face of Aldwin, whom I mistook as Deomer a lot in my recollections. He had this very tilted down face, serious. He looked like he had much to say, but maybe he was often told to remain quiet, resulting in that pinched expression that he carried with him.</p><p>I remember Deomer as being emotional and when he wasn&rsquo;t, I felt like he was about to be. Maybe I had a wrong impression of him. My child self really based everything on impressions, in which my lack of critical ability at the time was evident.</p><p>I remember Joanna being short even though I think I was only a few inches taller than her.</p><h3 id=realizations-and-regrets>Realizations and Regrets
<a class=anchor href=#realizations-and-regrets>#</a></h3><p>I remember when I and JM bullied this kid around our age, who was probably autistic from the intelligent way he handled himself. Well, honestly, I&rsquo;m not so sure anymore. He&rsquo;s probably well-read. Well-read, thoughtful, and subtle people gave this autistic impression when exhibited by kids.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t think we bulled the kid. I thought we were just teasing him, but now that I look back, I felt bad that we treated someone who was strange to our child selves—someone who acted like they relied on books, words, and logic to live their lives, as if they didn&rsquo;t know they were still a child.</p><h3 id=reflections-on-self>Reflections on Self
<a class=anchor href=#reflections-on-self>#</a></h3><p>I was never the type to bully, so I quickly forgave myself when I did recall that time of my life many years later.</p><h3 id=observations-in-church>Observations in Church
<a class=anchor href=#observations-in-church>#</a></h3><p>I remember the windows. We would always close the windows—I and my mom.</p><h3 id=interactions-with-others>Interactions with Others
<a class=anchor href=#interactions-with-others>#</a></h3><p>I remember seeing Ardy walking around through the side aisles of the church and across the roofed grounds with this deadpan, simple expression and gait.</p><h3 id=complexities-of-understanding>Complexities of Understanding
<a class=anchor href=#complexities-of-understanding>#</a></h3><p>I remember seeing her bare from the top, but I was too young to feel anything besides some level of curiosity considering my vague and very faint understanding of sex distinctions. When I grew up, I was still too young to care. I was strangely knowledgeable because I frequently met people from all kinds of enviroments—the kids and people in the slums and my more affluent cousin&rsquo;s family.</p><h3 id=an-environmental-description-of-the-church-pastors-family-house>An Environmental Description of the Church Pastor&rsquo;s Family House
<a class=anchor href=#an-environmental-description-of-the-church-pastors-family-house>#</a></h3><p>When I saw Ardy bare, I remember that she was sitting on that coach and the curvilinear grid design of its wooden sides. As a result of this, these sides invited me to insert my hand through them. In addition, I remember the strange sight and feeling of the green foam bedding on the coach.</p><p>I think I remember seeing portraits and various frames hanging on the wall in the middle of a dull, messy house. Particularly, the room was dark, and it looked like Ardy and JM were used to it. Furthermore, I remember the flash of diffused sunshine a little to my right amid the quiet. Specifically, this light aimed 45-degrees away from me at the wall to my right.</p><p>I remember that I was sitting next to the door which led to the open gray and red roof made of corrugated metal. In fact, I remember the glass windows composed of five or six panes of glass attached to adjustable metal latches on the sides. Significantly, I remember that these latches held the panes from the sides and in such a way that when one adjusted them by pulling them down or pushing them up, they angled the panes toward and to an alignment with one another or away from one another within a sequence of a closed phase or an open one, respectively. Regarding it as a design choice, I saw it in three places: the church, the house across the street from the church, the cement house on the right side in the middle street of Agro Homes from the viewpoint from the gate when entering. Lastly, I remember the way the diffused light of a cloudy day reflected through those bluish- or greenish-coated panes.</p><p>I remember the red pillows and small glass tables probably with magazines. Additionally, I remember the various positions of the dining table. Initially, I remember it next to the wall on the left from the viewpoint of the entrance. Secondly, I remember it in the middle of the area which was comprised of the kitchen area.</p><p>I remember the feeling of the linear pattern of the load-bearing wooden floor and the startingly distinct, tactile intermittence of the nails embedded in the floor.</p><h4 id=memories-of-family-interaction>Memories of Family Interaction
<a class=anchor href=#memories-of-family-interaction>#</a></h4><p>I remember lying down and pressing myself against the floor in anticipation of anyone entering the room. In addition, I remember the sight of the father of JM and Ardy and the awkwardness I felt while standing in his presence. Regarding this, his behavior extended to that outside of my expectations of what I expected from authority; however, I was curious, which made me gravitate toward a sense of open-minded awkwardness rather than defiance of those unknown.</p><p>I remember seeing JM sitting on the windowsill. Indeed, the wooden wall which included those bare windows looked termite-eroded with a diffusion of interconnecting cavities. Yet, these erosions could have been characteristic of a rare portion of the wall rather than representative of the majority of the makeup.</p><h4 id=description-of-household-items>Description of Household Items
<a class=anchor href=#description-of-household-items>#</a></h4><p>The countertop area of the house was mint-green–coated, and I remember seeing various metal cookware. Moreover, I think I remember seeing an array of kitchenware hanging on a rack attached to the mint-green wall. Also, I remember seeing physical pictures on the refrigerator next to the countertop on the farther side from the viewpoint of the entrance. Additionally, I remember the gray coating and the dark gray accent pigments of the refrigerator. From the viewpoint of the entrance, I remember the sunshine beaming across the windows and onto the wall on the west. Besides, I remember the white chairs and the bumpy way they interacted with the ground when one slid it octilinearly. From a top down view, provided that the entrance is at the westmost side at the bottom, the countertop is on the east side at the south side behind a wall oriented alongside and on the same side as the door. In the same area, the placements the dining table adopted changed over the years. Namely, this includes the placement next to the west wall a meter in front of the entrance and that placement in between the positions of the wall, the entrance, and the countertop which form the corners of a triangle. Anyway, I think I remember the position of a cabinet or a multi-receptacle storage container next to the west wall in between the door when it is in a open state and the table when it is next to the wall. In another portion of the room, I remember an enclosure of long seats with the glass table in the middle positioned at the top of the top-down layout and eastmost within the four-sided boundaries of the room which extends openly across the dining-kitchen area and that of the living room. Considering these boundaries, I remember that the TV was adjacent to the east boundary and a meter from the north boundary on a TV stand which I think accommodated receptacles and lay beneath two or so rows of shelves. Furthermore, I remember the door adjacent to the west boundary and on the northmost boundary which led to the open roof, an extension within the top-down layout. Similarly, two rooms extended from the east boundary while maintaining the linearity of the rectangular sides of the layout. In relation to their volume allocation, these rooms together shared a large portion of the layout. Moreover, a door connected these rooms each, while a photo hung in front of the doors high on the separating wall. Furthermore, I remember the pillows and the beds. Besides, I remember the lattice portions of the walls in the rooms. Finally, I think I remember seeing some portraits, specifically that of Kuya Dhan La Madrid and Ate Faye Ann.</p><h3 id=reflections-on-personal-growth>Reflections on Personal Growth
<a class=anchor href=#reflections-on-personal-growth>#</a></h3><p>We helped lots of people through outreaches. I had begun to believe that it was my mother who initiated all of these outreaches—the DVBS (Daily Vacation Bible School), etc.</p><h3 id=memories-of-schoolmates>Memories of Schoolmates
<a class=anchor href=#memories-of-schoolmates>#</a></h3><p>I&rsquo;m trying to remember Isaiah—what he was like. He had this smile, and he looked responsible.</p><p>Joecel was the type to remove his tie, and Isaiah was the type to keep his tie. Although I think it was Isaiah&rsquo;s looks and disposition that made him feel more polite.</p><p>I remember Gian, who sternly reprimanded me and made me cry while I was on the swing. I don&rsquo;t remember why.</p><p>I remember Teacher Ingrid reprimanded Gian soon after.</p><h3 id=reflections-on-self-improvement>Reflections on Self-Improvement
<a class=anchor href=#reflections-on-self-improvement>#</a></h3><p>When I finally realized I was going to become a six-grader, I thought my whole world was shifting like I was going to become like the way that Chinese novels depict the main character&rsquo;s apotheosis. I felt like I was reaching the heavens.</p><h3 id=changes-over-time>Changes Over Time
<a class=anchor href=#changes-over-time>#</a></h3><p>It was crazy how small my world was.</p><p>It was even more evident when I grew older and started to realize how much I didn&rsquo;t understand about the world.</p><p>Now, at 20 years old, I see so many things that I didn&rsquo;t know, and I don&rsquo;t want to go back.</p><h3 id=camp>Camp
<a class=anchor href=#camp>#</a></h3><p>I remember going to a camp where I rode a UV Express with my pastor and my fellow church members at the time. I remember seeing the darkness and the blue of the sky. I reemmber the lights of the hall of the camp. There was a swimming pool, but I believe I didn&rsquo;t swim. Or if I did, I didn&rsquo;t care so much at that point.</p><h3 id=swimming>Swimming
<a class=anchor href=#swimming>#</a></h3><p>That was around the time I had lost my curiosity and interest in swimming pools.</p><p>It was even more evident when I went with my family in 2020 many years later to a beach. I didn&rsquo;t go swimming. I just lay down and slept.</p><h3 id=2020>2020
<a class=anchor href=#2020>#</a></h3><p>I feel so proud of myself even after 2020. I&rsquo;m so much more improved. I read textbooks to pass the time, and I&rsquo;ve started uploading the music that I&rsquo;ve been learning for so many years. It&rsquo;s my way of paying back myself and the people around me from the past. My past self is no longer me. I keep changing, and documenting helps me stay awake and not go crazy. In fact, documenting is continuously making me understand the bigger world around me, even though it&rsquo;s been so many years since I&rsquo;ve been in that small school NCA.</p><h3 id=church-grounds>Church Grounds
<a class=anchor href=#church-grounds>#</a></h3><p>I remember the plants and the greenish blue walls where rarely, I would see cats take a dump there on the dirt.</p><h3 id=brotherly-regrets>Brotherly Regrets
<a class=anchor href=#brotherly-regrets>#</a></h3><p>I remember telling my youngest brother Timothy that he was adopted as a joke.

<a class=anchor href=#smiling-at-a-mirror>#</a></h3><p>At the time, I was speaking in front of the mirror and learning how to smile confidently and intentionally in order to socialize and do public oration better.</p><h3 id=tall-guys-and-fading-memories-of-people>Tall Guys and Fading Memories of People
<a class=anchor href=#tall-guys-and-fading-memories-of-people>#</a></h3><p>I remember the oldest in the NCA school just looking tall. I keep associating him with Sawali, a person from a school that I attented later—MCA. I feel hurt knowing that I&rsquo;ve blended them and many others in my recollections, which showed my poor understanding of people despite my constant exposure to a diverse multiplicity of persons.</p><p>I can confidently say though that this constant exposure was effective in teaching me how to live for others.</p><h3 id=helping-others>Helping Others
<a class=anchor href=#helping-others>#</a></h3><p>Learning how to become better at helping others led me to helping myself first because I realized how bad I was at helping even myself.</p><h3 id=church-memories>Church Memories
<a class=anchor href=#church-memories>#</a></h3><p>I remember singing in Church.</p><p>I remember my sister&rsquo;s unamused expression everytime I tried to implicate myself with the youth of the church.</p><p>It was years later that I went to other churches regularly even before my family&rsquo;s breakdown with our original, long-attending church due to sexual grooming of the pastor toward my mother.</p><h3 id=jm-climbing>JM Climbing
<a class=anchor href=#jm-climbing>#</a></h3><p>I would see JM climb the separated flag to get to the neighboring roof of the structure adjacent to the church. I would also see him peeing from the roof after—I believe—they made the roof of their house better.</p><h3 id=cousins-past>Cousin&rsquo;s Past
<a class=anchor href=#cousins-past>#</a></h3><p>I remember seeing my cousin and how he lived day-to-day. I remember him being much more easier to hang out with, playing video games in the game console Wii. I remember Wii as well due to my other cousin from my father&rsquo;s side, although I don&rsquo;t know them well.</p><p>So my cousin who I once played video games in Wii with soon became this more chubby person. I didn&rsquo;t really think about it much. I had this elevated impression of him due to his family being affluent. I didn&rsquo;t really doubt him much, and I had an optimist impression of others and the world.</p><h3 id=changes-with-churches>Changes with Churches
<a class=anchor href=#changes-with-churches>#</a></h3><p>It was only after many things happened—the breakdown with the church and the other churches connected to it, whom I had long-standing friendships in, rejection from a crush, and the dismissive interaction I had with the teachers, who just didn&rsquo;t ask and thought I was acting rebellious.</p><p>I need to clarify that the other churches connected to my original church were manifold, and I would go there often with my mother. My mother was very inactive at home, always going outside, but to me, since I was always with her, I felt that she was present and authoritative due to her authority and confident oration in the different churches and events.</p><p>The aforementioned camp was part of that church network.</p><h3 id=tablet>Tablet
<a class=anchor href=#tablet>#</a></h3><p>I remember when we got a tablet presumably for the first time and I was so happy as if we finally became valedictorians or something. It was from our relatives from my dad&rsquo;s side during a Christmas party.</p><h3 id=parties>Parties

<a class=anchor href=#feeling-small-and-familiarity>#</a></h3><p>I remember waking up in the morning and getting up, feeling like I was the smallest thing in the world. As I grew up, I felt like everything around me was smaller than I thought. The streets now look so familiar, as if I could go through these streets and no one would care. The streets that held so many memories means nothing to an outsider of those memories. I feel weak knowing that if I don&rsquo;t document this, no one would know and be able to prove that it ever happened.</p><h3 id=nca-store>NCA Store
<a class=anchor href=#nca-store>#</a></h3><p>I remember the store in NCA where I would buy pancit canton cooked by the person selling there—Mary. I remember buying packaged biscuit and fudgy chocolate there. I remember eating plain junk food and sipped Zest-o juice from cartons. Drinking Zest-o juice was like drinking a delicacy among my classmates at the time. It only felt like a delicacy because of the community that surrounded the practice.</p><h3 id=malou>Malou

<a class=anchor href=#pastors-family-house>#</a></h3><p>I remember going to JM, Pastore, Pastor, Ardy, and Faye&rsquo;s house and thinking that it looked musky and messy. I remember the pillows that didn&rsquo;t have covers, the windows, and the wood that looked like it would feel rough and edgy.</p><h3 id=dvbs>DVBS
<a class=anchor href=#dvbs>#</a></h3><p>I remember drawing and coloring in the DVBS in Porttown (fake name). I remember the cement and the trash all around.

<a class=anchor href=#buses-burnout-and-rage>#</a></h3><p>I remember riding many buses. I remember seeing so many faces in the buses and their many concerns, but they didn&rsquo;t make me feel too troubled. It was only when I quit school out of burnout and began to learn how to live at home that I started to feel more and more emotional. It was the first time that anger had a visible mark on my face, but I did show some anger when I was younger. Though, this time, my anger began to take the form of uncontrolled rage.</p><h3 id=mental-breakdown>Mental Breakdown

<a class=anchor href=#gym-sickness>#</a></h3><p>I cried when I got sick after too much aircon and working out so much at the gym for the first two months I&rsquo;ve been there.

<a class=anchor href=#bad-memories-with-the-gym-older-cousin-and-half-sister>#</a></h3><p>I went back to the gym in February and stayed until the end of March, wherein I left due to wanting more out of my life than just the gym. The way people acted in the gym was so immature and so telling of a lifestyle that lacked the knowledge of the complexities of persons. I just wanted to live life thinking about a broader goal than just get better at the gym than anyone else. I had no struggle with my own masculinity, but I knew what frustration was, especially when I got sick. I never felt the need to be more masculine. I felt the need to assert myself after encountering my cousin&rsquo;s older brother, who made me feel like shit. My father as well forced upon me that necessity to stand up for myself and my siblings. I still remember my older half-sister and oldest half-brother telling off my other half-brother to the point that a fire emerged in me. The fire of wanting to assert myself. I wanted to stand up for others. It used to just be wanting to help people, but after I learned that knowing how to help was crucial.</p><h3 id=amanda-mei-dantes-and-cousins>Amanda Mei Dantes and Cousins

She is also the one wearing blue with red stipes with blonde hair. This picture was posted by Caroline Ariglo in February 28, 2016. The caption reads:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>NYI Leadership Conference with Amanda Mei Dantes Arlyn Betil Calag Nhel Rosero Zara Doms @Novaliches Church of the Nazarene. #🚙☺😊— with Arlyn Betil Calag and 3 others at United Hills Village (UPS1).</p></blockquote><p>I remember many occasions that most likely contributed to this assertiveness—I remember this girl from another church within the church network who told me that it was bad that I was so indecisive when I was dining with her in a fast-food restaurant during a break in an event. I remember my cousin&rsquo;s older brother who told me not to overshare and talked to me about writing a fictional epic world. My cousin, his older brother, and his older sister talked and listened to me, hearing my concerns about liking a girl who was 7+ years (I&rsquo;m pretty sure) my age in a different church. I remember the older sister smoking and the older brother smoking standing outside their house.</p><p>They used to live in a bigger house, but after their father died, they moved to a smaller one.</p><h3 id=staying-with-my-cousins>Staying with My Cousins
<a class=anchor href=#staying-with-my-cousins>#</a></h3><p>If I remember correctly, when they listened to my concerns, it wasn&rsquo;t a one-time period. It was over the time that I stayed with them for several days, maybe even longer. I remember before we were outside their house, we were eating outside with my older brother and my older sister and her boyfriend Glenn. I remember thinking that my cousin&rsquo;s older sister was attractive because she looked eerily similar to my crush from school. Soon after that, we went inside their house. I believe I had cried. My cousin&rsquo;s older brother, Mike, introduced me to a game Epic Seven. I remember the smell of the microwaved sandwiches. I remember the smell of the wooden chairs, the walls, and the lights. I remember the smell of the white, one-person sofa. I remember the TV wherein I saw them once playing the video game The Wolf Among Us by that Telltale Games. I remember the sound of the game console Switch and the feeling of playing Breath of the Wild in it.</p><p>I remember the smell of the bed and the level of echo within the kitchen. In their home, I remember so many occasions. This is but one of them.</p><p>I remember when they talked to me again about my crush with the girl who was much older than me. This girl sang, and she sang at another church wherein I began to attend. I think that at that time, I was already attending with the praise and worship team. Yes, I believe so because when I finished staying at my cousin&rsquo;s, they dropped me off at that church.</p><h3 id=new-life-church>New Life Church
<a class=anchor href=#new-life-church>#</a></h3><p>I remember the face of the manifold people at the church. I remember the textured flooring and the glass doors that opened to a wide hub that led to many different church services. It was a big place. I remember the faint smell of the aircon compared to the wet, grassy smell of the rain outside.</p><h3 id=walking>Walking
<a class=anchor href=#walking>#</a></h3><p>I remember walking a lot. I remember walking and traveling around a lot with my mother whenever we would go to various events for many years.</p><p>I remember seeing many different environments.</p><p>I remember when I got approached by a woman, who I assumed to be a prostitute.</p><p>I remember when I was still at DVBS wherein I would accompany many kids to the park in my subdivision. I remember seeing the faces of the women that resided in the house directly in front of the Nazarene church.</p><p>I remember seeing the hallway after we rode the elevator to the condo of my Dad&rsquo;s mother.</p><p>I remember crying after my mother cheated on my father in a condo like that one. I remember praying so hard and becoming more faithful after that, or maybe I felt more faithful. In reality, I have shown to be a very pious person who prayed even when it would normally be embrassing.</p><p>I remember seeing the various faces and people at the beach when we went there on the tents in COVID 2020&mldr; probably. I remember the food we ate on the foldable table we brought—the burger I believe.</p><p>I remember seeing the variety of cars parked when we went to BGC.</p><p>I remember the various cars parked whenever we went to the numerous coffee beans and starbucks we went to.</p><p>I remember drawing enough to remember at the coffee bean in ATC.</p><p>I remember the drawing I produced after all that. I don&rsquo;t have the drawing files, but I do remember the webtoon I produced. I can still access this webtoon.</p><p>I remember the various webnovels I read—The Lord of the Mysteries (quite recent), Reverend Insanity, and &ldquo;Everybody Loves Large Chests&rdquo; \parencite{exterminatus:largechests}, among others.</p><p>I remember reading many webcomics.</p><p>I remember reading many mangas. I feel weird knowing that these worlds were so vast.</p><p>I remember watching One Piece up to near the end of the Dressrosa arc.</p><p>I remember watching Barney a lot when I was younger.</p><p>I remember reading so many webtoons: Devil Number 4, among others.</p><p>I still remember that manga Missions of Love that I read while listening to the remixed version of the song Why? by Shawn Mendes ft. Leon Bridges while in my older sister&rsquo;s room.</p><p>I remember the many Internet Flash games that I played on Y8 and Armorgames especially, the card games that I played, the Filipino children&rsquo;s games that I played, the children&rsquo;s games that I made up with my younger brothers, among others.</p><p>I remember the creations of my youngest brother, especially his paper crafts and clay figures.</p><p>I remember seeing the clay residue on the floor and in between the tiles.</p><p>I remember seeing the sky that grew red on the day of tribulation in my dreams. I remember the moon shifting from white to red.</p><p>I remember the dream wherein I saw many figures that were gray and a rare few that were white. I remember seeing through the buildings as if in a video game and seeing many figures around. I remember waking up due to fear that I was not among those white.</p><p>I remember the dream in the street wherein my house was at and being chased and harassed by ghosts.</p><p>I remember the dream where I saw myself being eaten alive by lions from afar.</p><p>I remember the dream where I was defending ag-ainst zombies in my family&rsquo;s apartment. I remember feeling scared and jumping off the balcony, falling to the spikes of the gate of our house. I think that in that dream, naturally, some of my family were there and they got caught. Maybe, before jumping off, I was on the first floor rather than on the second floor at the start of the dream. I forgot.</p><p>Even my dream last night I don&rsquo;t remember.</p><p>I remember going to so many swimming pool resorts.</p><p>I remember going to an expensive cottage that was lent to us by a client of my parents.</p><p>I remember going to a national competition wherein my school NCA joined. I remember being part of a relay race with Jeri, Joecel, Me, and Sebastian.</p><p>I remember the feeling of riding a transporation vehicle with my classmates and looking outside at the sunlit sights of the place where we had the national competition. I remember Sebastian and his mother who were kind to me and helped me get through vehicle sickness.</p><p>I remember Clarence whose family owned a pizza place. I remember Clarence and the clumsy way he walked. I remember when we played basketball and the way he moved. He&rsquo;s gone now, far away.</p><p>I remember Raven. He used to be short, but now he&rsquo;s tall.</p><p>I remember that girl who was really short. There were many actually, but I remember that girl and another girl.</p><p>I remember Clara, Lyka.</p><p>I searched up Lyka&rsquo;s name because I forgot. I&rsquo;m slowly forgetting. I forgot her brother&rsquo;s name as well.</p><p>I forgot the small, chubby kid with glasses from MCA. There were many.</p><p>I remember&mldr;</p><p>I remember Jenrey. No, I don&rsquo;t remember Jenrey.</p><p>I&rsquo;m lying to myself.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t remember them at all.</p><p>They were a small mark on my history, and yet, each of them contributed so much to my understanding and perspective of the world.</p><p>I&rsquo;m looking through Facebook, and now, I can see many names. Tristan from MCA, Leonard from NCA, Evangelista from MCA, Samuel from MCA, Samuel and Shekinah from NCA, and Richelle Rivena from MCA, among others.</p><p>I remember so many faces.</p><p>I remember so many faces.</p><p>I&rsquo;m going crazy knowing that I knew so many people, and I cannot do anything to help them.</p><p>I can just watch.</p><p>I see the faces in my dreams, especially those from MCA. I see them frequently interacting with me in so many different scenarios.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know how to help.</p><p>I&rsquo;m so angry at myself. I want to save everyone that I&rsquo;ve met, but how can I? I shouldn&rsquo;t force them. I shouldn&rsquo;t&mldr; I was taught so many times not to help and only to be more self-focused in order to develop my helping ability. I am so conflicted.</p><p><a href=https://chat.openai.com/share/c4cfb0ae-4269-4b14-a182-64095f0a4000>https://chat.openai.com/share/c4cfb0ae-4269-4b14-a182-64095f0a4000</a></p><p>I see so many people from stories and from reality.</p><p>I remember when a person fought with his wife in the original church. There was shouting, and I was there.</p><p>Debt caused NCA to fall under.</p><p>I remember seeing the airport where we got Mom after she went to some place. I don&rsquo;t remember. We also fetched Ate, my older sister.</p><p>I remember seeing the giant wall in front of a remote parking lot in Makati City. I think the reason why we were there was for SM Asia.</p><p>I remember going with Ate Priscilla, Ate Rica, and Ate Daniella at a Planetshakers concert.</p><p>I remember seeing the manifold congregation at the Araneta Coliseum during the National Prayer Gathering, probably 30th one at 2019. It could the 29th one, Feast of Tabernacles one (2018), Feast of Trumpets one, or something else.</p><p>I remember Encounter Weekned at my original church. I remember the dude who was there. We slept on tables. It was fun. I still feel that that time was new to me.</p><p>The pictures are not enough to cover all the emotions that give me a faint understanding of things that exist. They&rsquo;re all beyond my reach, but if I had a picture I would remember. I can at least imagine the manifold images that pop in my mind.</p><p>I remember the rain when we were coming out of that person&rsquo;s house with Denver and Denzel. I remember the narrow walkway and the neighboring canals. The rain was so strong, but it was enjoyable to be inside, listening to devotionals.</p><p>I remember in Quezon. I remember the feeling of drizzling whenever we walked uphill on the road that led to and from Lola Cecille&rsquo;s house.</p><p>I remember the cow that used to be there on the field neighboring the road. Lola Cecille said once that there used to be pigs.</p><p>It was one of my first experiences with cable TV since I grew up watching only CDs and DVDs when I was younger.</p><p>I remember buying CDs and DVDs (a more premium version I believe) in VideoCity, now defunct.</p><p>I remember playing the MMORPG Redstone Online for a while.</p><p>I remember seeing the MMORPG Flyff.</p><p>I remember seeing my friend JM play Growtopia and listening to a variety of sounds and music in regular places like my original church.</p><p>I remember seeing the sides of the ridge at night when we were traveling the ridge. I think it was mount pinatubo.</p><p>I remember when I was at the restaurant Italliano&rsquo;s and said the word critique, the manager flinched.</p><p>I remember saying that The Chainsmokers didn&rsquo;t sound good live in a restaurant that was playing their music. I was particularly loud that the staff turned down the music. I don&rsquo;t remember what I felt, but maybe more aware of my influence on others as a contradiction of my little expectations of myself.</p><p>I remember the many times where I was in the bathroom and thinking this was the last time I would be alive.</p><p>I remember listening to Ben and Ben and Ed Sheer-an&rsquo;s Happier when I got rejected by Lauren.</p><p>I remember the painful feeling of rashes and trying not to rub my rashy back. I remember going to pharmaceutical store and my mom showing them underneath my rashy torso.</p><p>I believe I got rashes from eating something that I was allergic to. The food was that Japanese food that I ate in the food court in SM Mall.</p><p>I remember going outside alongside Badjoy and the youth group to Festival many times.</p><p>I remember the feeling of lying down in the room where I&rsquo;m in and hearing my eldest half-brother laughing at me because I thought I heard Plants vs Zombies music. At the time, I believe we just moved in here, so maybe when I was very young.</p><p>I remember I woke up one time feeling so guilty for a reason I don&rsquo;t know. I was repeating &ldquo;I kissed you.&rdquo; to my Mom. I remember feeling so guilty but never actually doing the act. I think that might&rsquo;ve been a precursor to my psychotic features from bipolar.</p><p>I remember lying down in the balcony at night because of a fight.</p><p>I remember the loud sound of concerts and events.</p><p>I remember the mentally ill person at an event wherein it was so awkward because this person was near us and speaking in gibberish. No one stopped him. He just became quiet after a painfully long time.</p><p>I remember the feeling of deliver a tithes and offering message in front of the friends of Ardy.</p><p>I heard Ardy got a girlfriend, so I guess that means she&rsquo;s either bi or lesbian.</p><p>I remember seeing the posh-looking people at the wedding of Mike and the posh-looking people at Teams Ministries.</p><p>I remember seeing a 1000-peso tithes once.</p><p>I remember Kuya Mark would accompany me going to Teams.</p><p>I remember writing stories in the old VAOI laptop. I remember using calmly writer to write the book &ldquo;What Do I Want&rdquo;. I remember feeling so comfy and I would type on the rectangular table in my Dad&rsquo;s room or I would type in the kids&rsquo; room on a cabinet beside a tall stack of CDs.</p><p>I remember loving the darkness of the room as I wrote.</p><p>I remember the feeling of getting introduced to Manga Rock, which is now paid. I remember feeling enlightened and a little wrong when Jeremiah introduced it to me.</p><p>I remember fasting alongside Jeremiah for 24 hours after returning to Jeremiah&rsquo;s home during that event at the Araneta Coliseum.</p><p>I remember the feeling of the bathrooms at resorts. It would range from murky to clean to smelly to full of fruity scents.</p><p>I remember the feeling of going to Mcdonalds. For most of my life, it was like riding a luxury cruise. We experienced relative social mobility.</p><p>I remember the milky champorado we fed the DVBS kids and the clear white milk in a spiral on the surface. (I saw a picture.)</p><hr><p>I remember watching porn of many things. I remember reading hentai. I remember watching hentai. I remember liking hentai for a long time before finding a reason to enjoy real-life porn. I remember masturbating before I understood it. I just enjoyed the feeling of rubbing it against pillows. I remember the euphoria.</p><p>I remember watching VTubers for the first time and them sparking something in me.</p><p>I remember watching Wifi, that Korean &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; VTuber whose design included a turquiose hair color and outfit. There was a wifi symbol tattoo mark on her chin. I remember that one Korean VTuber—Nagi—who was kinda sus.</p><p>I remember talking To Mikko on the bus and enjoying myself. I remember the water jug either (or both) he and Jared brought.</p><p>I remember that girl who transferred and then left after only a year. She seemed to like me, but I was uninterested. Her name was&mldr;</p><p>I remember that other girl Icah. (only spelled it correctly after searching.)</p><p>I remember that dude with glasses from MCA who looked like John Joshua</p><p>I remember that girl from MCA who I thought was Kelsey and stared long enough to look like I liked her. Her personality, along with that senior Ashley, never really made me feel butterflies. I don&rsquo;t know why.</p><p>I remember training with Coach Peter.</p><p>I remember training with Coach Ryan.</p><p>In the ridge travel with Norman, the person who I was familiar with who was an authority of sorts, in mouth pinatubo (I think), I almost fell but was caught.</p><p>I remember when Charles &ldquo;Niko&rdquo; Hilapo talked to me in a weird way while dribbling at the side of the practice court. We were doing training at the time, and I remember doing so much push-ups beyond what my body could handle especially considering I had studies and projects to tend to at the time. The person who made me and Aidan, a close classmate of mine, do those push-ups was the cousin of the girl I had a crush on. I remember reporting him to the principal.</p><p>I remember reading this old book with a name that started with or had the name &ldquo;Captain&rdquo;. It had words that I thought felt old-fashioned. The sentence structure was very old-fashioned.</p><p>I remember this book reading this webcomic app that had coins and—I don&rsquo;t know why—but I liked it. In hindsight, the stories I read were kinda shit, but I just found it new and kind of breaking away from what I usually consumed.</p><p>I remember buying so many visual books and enjoying the feeling of just prizing that 40-peso book. I don&rsquo;t know why, but 40 pesos felt like a luxury at the time. So I really felt strongly toward any book that was cheap but which I felt was worth it.</p><p>I remember playing mobile applications such as Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, Zombie Tsunami, and Jetpack Joyride, among others.</p><p>I remember grabbing so many things from under the bookshelves and the feeling of dirt. At one point, I really was afraid of possibly spiders and rats, but for the most part, I just threw my hand in there and dirtied myself.</p><p>I was already fairly used to mud and the feeling of dirt from walking around so much.</p><p>I remember the big storm—I think during Yolanda. I remember hearing about the trees that fell.</p><p>I remember hearing about a fire that burned a house up in the highest part of the subdivision.</p><p>In the past, I remember seeing the old blood stains of a motorcycle accident on the road from the previous night.</p><p>I remember enjoying the feeling of grabbing a book in a bookstore—National Bookstore, especially—and feeling sneaky over the fact that I could read books there.</p><p>I remember eating out at Max&rsquo;s restaurant, flanking the main road, the one in front of the access road leading to the subdivsion a couple of times. I remember on one occasion, we were with Tita Maris. On several occasions, we were with relatives on Dad&rsquo;s side.</p><p>I remember going to Ministop a couple of times and thinking that the ice cream was luxurious, fancy, and elegant. The chicken, there, I thought was even more exuberant.</p><p>I remember the clothes that Tita Maris gifted me, including the white one and the red one and forgetting them in a bus. I felt bad about that.</p><p>I remember the feeling of buying clothes and the luxurious, ultra-rich feeling of getting clothes from relatives, from Tita Maris, and from buying ourselves.</p><p>It was like being the richest man on the block. I felt like a super star.</p><p>I remember using Tita Maris&rsquo; phone and watching hentai on it. I think it was the Yosuga no Sora one. It was so putrid, but hey, I actually was able to masturbate in the same house as my cousin somehow. I remember dropping the phone and getting nicely told off because they learned after learning the memory card was loose inside.</p><p>I remember the rain in the celebration of the new mansion-looking place where I saw the rain hitting the underwater from underwater. I remember it because of the surreal size and elegance of the mansion, the casualness of the people around, and my ocsillation between above water and underwater to feel safe and enjoy the rain.</p><p>I remember the disappointment on Tito Joel&rsquo;s face when he realized that I didn&rsquo;t learn guitar at all in one year. I remember my reaction and that growing emptiness that I revealed through my gradual loss of enthusiasm in my playing while at the Christmas party. This is one of the factors that contributed to my urge to learn guitar.</p><p>I remember the feeling that after all these years of keeping it in and the conflict that I felt inside after my rich experiences, I felt helpless, only staring outside the window. It was all bubbling inside me, leading to my disposition of anger. All the innocuous behavior I showed began to take a halt and show a decadence that I could only compute as logical and reasonable considering the interplay of different disruptive events that one might consider life-changing.</p><p>Three factors for my decision to take on a more angry and assertive manner of disposition:</p><ol><li>The manifold experiences of teaching and learning that I picked up and listened to throughout my life</li><li>The understanding that others&rsquo; behavior was contradictory to what they taught me to be right—contradictory and hypocritical.</li><li>The deep-seated understanding that the only way to help was to stand up for myself and for those around me, even if it means changing who I knew myself to be—subtle, timid, and a long-standing spectator.</li></ol><p>I remember the feeling of hatred toward the feelings of depression that I felt. I was not to be helpless. I was not to be weak. I was not to be timid. I was taught not to overshare. I was taught not to help others (because I didn&rsquo;t know how). I was taught to become stronger. I was taught to become better.</p><p>The overwhelming perfectionism that the circumstances instilled on me made me decide to take my life several times and failed in all those times.</p><p>I prayed to God that I could die to prevent the proliferation of wickedness because I believed I would become evil like my father.</p><p>I would become just like them, and no manner of pride was not going to save me. Because as soon as I think I am not evil, I will be.</p><p>It is the understanding that I am only as evil as I am unable to help others that I feel the urge to survive and become thriving.</p><p>I remember the sun and the feeling of the heat upon my shoulders when I walked. The countless times I felt sweat as I traveled. The feeling of nausea that I learned to tame through avoiding the heat and being more careful with the way I walked. My ability to walk more efficiently faciliated my mental capacity to take on the challenge of the sun.</p><p>I remember the feeling of praying. The feeling of speaking in tongues. I remember begging and begging and hoping that I could become a better person. And that desire continues to live in me. I wasn&rsquo;t saved from my tribulation, but that didn&rsquo;t break my faith. I just found out that it didn&rsquo;t make sense to me logically. I lost it gradually, feeling this conflict growing and starting to eat at the way I sang when I was in the praise and worship team. Soon enough, I had to halt everything and run.</p><p>The burnout took on a ghastly form, pulling at my limbs and crushing my head to the ground.</p><p>I saw myself as a mere plaything for the wills of the world to mold arbitrarily.</p><p>I remember watching DanTDM and just enjoying watching the Custom Maps. I thought they were the most creative, curious, and subtle thing of my life. I had to double take everytime I saw one of those videos because they made me feel this excitement.</p><p>I remember the dog that ran from the house up the street and stop at the intersection between streets inside the subdivision. I breathed quickly and didn&rsquo;t yelp or scream or say anything because it happenedd so fast. I escaped.</p><p>I remember being on Incredibots and the Minecraft forums. I remember the feeling of making maps like and making Incredibots robots.</p><p>I saw in my mails super chibi knight when I subscribed in 2014. It was still very new to me at the time. I remember playing Chibi Knight and thinking that was fun.</p><p>I remember the stare Peter gave me because I was so cold in the night just a while ago tonight (7/5/2023). I remember putting my feet atop the pillow and off the floor, trying to avoid the cold. I remember placing myself further under the table I was sleeping. I remember that Peter turned down the aircon.</p><p>This is probably because of the pictures, but I can remember the familiar but somewhat blurry face of the Mcdonalds staff at Tagaytay. I remember the gray walls, and the feeling of drinking coffee that I got from another place. I probably got from Starbucks or something and brought it into Mcdonalds. I remember the balcony there. I remember the stepped structure that you could see from the balcony even without leaning on the balustrades or railings. I remember the feeling of holding the plastic cup and probably the brown paper tissue around its bottom half. I remember the round table that was as high as my knees while I sat down. I forgot what kind of chair.</p><p>I remember another occasion where we were doing PACEs. I saw the pictures, so I remembered. I remembered the feeling of just seeing them erase the PACEs. I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck I was feeling. Looking back now. I&rsquo;m surprised I don&rsquo;t remember any strong emotions from that time, but I most likely had some because I can only imagine the idea of PACEs as something more than just a walk in the park. That was probably around the time I was still home-schooled. Yeah, I believe it was before I went to MCA. Krisha, Ardy, Ate Danielle, Mom, and I were there at that Mcdonalds in Tagaytag. I think Kuya Mark was there, but I&rsquo;m not sure.</p><p>I remember another occasion where we would go and bring the Katutubo Youth to the condo and that we waited very long at the entrance. We were sitting down, and I had no phone and just stood there, singing from time to time. I remember standing behind the truck and the bright lights that shone from the entrance. I remember what looked like an the empty pool past the entrance. I remember the tense feeling of listening to my Mom talk about why the person who offered them a condo stay was not awake. It was nighttime, and we were waiting for the person who offered the condo to wake up and contact the guards that we were authorized. I remember the feeling of waiting so long. I remember being told to call the two youth katutubo who were sitting down on the other side of a car entrance at a entrance walkway for people. I, my Mom, and Ate Danielle were sitting down on the other side where there was a bench. A guard went over and sat there, watching Youtube or something. It was Tagalog. I remember seeing Dad sleeping and just walking around the car, feeling bored. I remember Mom apologizing. Soon, I went home on the car. Mom and Ate Danielle went home through public transportation. I think the katutubo were unable to go to the condo and that Mom just made them at some place. Or maybe I&rsquo;m wrong and they got to go to the condo.</p><p>I remember another occasion where I was standing up, watching Jhon Peter Camacho or something sitting down on his haunches or squatting. I remember thinking that was weird for some reason. I think I realized that the way I squatted was different from the way he squatted. He squatted with his feet flat. I squatted on tiptoe. I think I remember squatting as well while he was squatting. This was during a resort thing I believe. We were among many others at the time, waiting for the resort gates to open if I remember correctly. It was early morning.</p><p>I remember going to the university thing in some place. I remember the various people that were there. I remember seeing many teenagers just having fun and hanging around. I remember seeing the many stalls and many items of one such stall. I remember sitting down on a wooden, foldable chair. I remember the covers around the stalls. I remember seeing the katutubo&rsquo;s stern expressions due to their inexperience with fast urban life. These katutubo were getting a chance to experience it and through working alongside Lyka and Samantha, two people that worked under my sister at a coffee stall. I remember being on the car and feeling weird. I remember the feeling of going through the crowds and just feeling like this was familiar but also very congested. I remember seeing the back of a hamburger truck and just thinking that it looked like the front. I remember Dad telling me that we could eat anything. I remember not eating anything there in the end and just went to Starbucks after an hour or something or walking. I remember that before that, we even walked around the streets outside of the university for a while. I remember talking to Dad regarding the difficulty of managing and being a CEO and traveling from country to country. I remember saying that I didn&rsquo;t want to do that, or maybe I&rsquo;m wrong in this particularly. I remember the older Filpino dude who seemed half-Western who gave the katutubo youth a place to stay. I remember hearing the singing at the stage there and just feeling that the singing sounded bad at one rare point. I remember the strange way the singer sang. I remember the loud sound through the microphone of the person doing Master of Ceremonies kind of thing. I remember the people in the crowd congesting close to the stage. I remember walking around and seeing so many banners on the many stalls there. I remember seeing a banner for Earth science stuff. I remember seeing so many banners that contained siomai. I remember seeing a stall that looked like a dark, red-lit club where people did drugs. I remember seeing two women holding hands and thinking that they were probably gay. I remember carrying a heavy bag and feeling that it was heavy. I remember sitting on my haunches while holding the bag to distribute the weight (weight-bearing patterns). I remember talking to my Dad at length at the Starbucks. In that university, my mother and the two assigned, Lyka and Samantha, were selling coffee there.</p><p>I remember imagining a picture of that university where I was told there were going to lots of stalls. This picture sort of looked like that event place in Manila where I attended a seminar regarding farming, especially tree farming.</p><p>I remember watching an edit about the various &ldquo;sigma&rdquo; figures—Breaking bad characters Walter White and Jesse Pinkman, titular character from Taxi Driver, titular character, Lou Bloom, from Nightcrawler, titular character from Bladerunner 2049, Patrick Bateman from American Psycho, Joker from Joker, titular character from Scarface, &ldquo;manlier&rdquo; titular character from Fight Club (it was actually se7en (I had to look through the comments)), character from There Will Be Blood, Saul Goodman from Better Call Saul, and character from Donnie Darko.</p><p>I remember watching that Dead Poets Society end scene and thinking about it when I felt suicidal. I remember that it was a very striking film.</p><p>I remember watching those Korean prank videos. I saw one that was only released 2 years ago, which meant I was watching some in mid 2021.</p><p>I remember playing the Alex the crocodile 2 game when I was younger. I remember playing the Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! game and feeling that it was immersive. I remember playing Dino Run, Sonny, and Crossfire, among others.</p><p>Crossfire was such a fun game to play even if I wasn&rsquo;t into FPS. I enjoyed buying Garena shells, digital prepaid cards, and redeeming them alongside my older half-brother David. I remember the feeling of scratching at them with one-peso coin. I remember being taught to hack by crouching on the box multiple times up and down. I remember the feeling of playing with an AWP gun and enjoying the sound and reload. I remember playing with an M16 and just feeling that it was weak but fun to play in its own way. I remember enjoying the different knives. I bought the axe with Garena shells. I loved the sound of being in the menu theme of the game. I searched up and remembered the mass mutation mode. It was so fun to fight against the mutant. I loved the feeling of just being a mutant as well. I remember the various maps. I remember playing with Badjoy, Ram, James carl, David, and Peter. I remember trying to get Timothy to play it as well. I remember the sounds of the mutant infection. I remember seeing the supply crate. I remember the various guns. I remember the sound of the ax as I swung it.</p><p>I was so excited to go out and buy Garena shells dang!</p><p>I remember walking in the streets in front of Soldiers and just buying some shells.</p><p>I remember the Chinese map in Crossfire. I remember the excitement of getting wall heat shots.</p><p>I remember magical feeling of reading the manga Missions of Love. I enjoyed it so much for some reason that I binged it.</p><p>I remember the League of Legends I played when I was much younger. I remember an early game of me playing Rammus bot lane. I remember crying because I got insulted by Jerry, an NCA classmate, when I lost. I think Jerry apologized, but I don&rsquo;t remember exactly. I remember playing in the computer shops and treating my friends to 1,000 pesos of playing time. This 1,000 pesos was a gift from relatives. That was a rare occasion. 1,000 pesos was like a rare one-time chance.</p><p>I remember apologizing to the older Sawali, a senior from MCA, when he shushed me for being too loud in the choir. The choir practice was a tense place especially with the stern teacher we had.</p><p>I remember fixing the chairs alongside my MCA classmates from the same class in the tiny church area of MCA.</p><p>Crossfire was a long time of my life I feel. I want to delve at length into it.</p><p>I remember watching Tanya the Evil on the Ani-one channel on Youtube and just enjoying it, especially the frustration Tanya showed because the brass didn&rsquo;t trust her judgment.</p><p>I remember watching Ergo Proxy and thinking it was the most interesting show I&rsquo;ve read in a while. However, the thing is that I haven&rsquo;t been watching shows much that I found interesting.</p><p>I remember Crossfire and know that it was a long experience because of the various rounds I played in it. I remember the various emotions I felt while playing. Getting a quadra kill in there was like a rarity, but I was able to do it a handful times. I remember the tense feeling of playing seriously against good AWPers, or players who use AWPS. In those situations, it would be so scary to peek and try to ascertain where they are and shoot.</p><p>I remember being in a camp and one of the games with the game fascilitator. In those events where people played games and went from game 1 to game 4, sometimes the sequence was random. There were many teams, and each team tried to be the fastest to finish all games. I remember being in a kubo and listening to people talking all around. I don&rsquo;t remember what game and what for.</p><p>I remember a game where we tried to find the coin from a pile of powdered milk with our mouths or straw. I might be wrong about using the mouth.</p><p>I remember many musical chairs games (Trip to Jerusalem). Sometimes, we would incorporate dancing as well.</p><p>I remember the feeling of reading the manga Prom-ised Neverland and just enjoying the fantastical feel of it. When I read it, it&rsquo;s probably been a long time since I felt like that.</p><p>The anime Magus&rsquo; Bride also gave the feeling of depth, but I didn&rsquo;t end up watching it so much.</p><p>I remember the feeling of playing Stronghold Crusaders and playing with my siblings many times. I enjoyed it so much that I remembered it even though we only played the demo.</p><p>I remember the so many League of Legends games I played. I remember one time that I played fizz and threw the game. I remembered it because it was so unusual of me to do so.</p><p>I remember Wow Wow Wubbzy. The robots, the underwater game, and the adventurer game.</p><p>I remember playing the Sims 3, the Java one, on my Mom&rsquo;s phone. I enjoyed the fishing mechanic and felt so sneaky once I started doing romance there. I think this game is why I never got interested in newer games in a similar genre of people (Stardew Valley and such) because I really had my long-standing experience with games like this (maybe it was only this one).</p><p>I remember watching The modern Sims game on the TV and just getting told of because I was watching it with my siblings. What I was also watching was the popular Youtube video where this dude cheats on his wife by getting with the maid. I was so puberty. I remember that I was sitting at the middle of the staircase and then listening to my mother admonishing me regarding it.</p><p>I remember playing the old Minecraft Launcher. It was so fun to just play Minecraft in old computer shops at the time. I remember two computer shops. The one near Soldiers. And the one in our subdivision. I think they&rsquo;ve both closed since then.</p><p>I saw a picture where I went to Tagaytay and saw squares on the lake. They&rsquo;re either meant for farming or for fishing or something.</p><p>I remember the various people that I met in the camp where I called myself &ldquo;Luke.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember hearing a story that there was a prostitute that waltz into the computer shop in Soldiers.</p><p>I remember eating at many Japanese and Chinese restaurants. I remember the smell of the coach of many Chinese restaurants. I have a picture where I was sitting down on a coach in a Chinese restaurant. It was nice.</p><p>I remember the awkwardness of eating and then hearing the sound of forks and spoons hitting the plates a little loudly during our gatherings with relatives from my Dad&rsquo;s side.</p><p>I remember the concern of my aunt Cristine from my Dad&rsquo;s side during those gatherings and when she called our landline from time to time. At first, for many years, I thought she was a concerned aunt, but as time passed, I learned from my parents that she had her circumstances. That changed the context with which I perceived her. That look of faint disappointment that I saw in my Dad&rsquo;s face was the same one he gave us, his children. That comparison, after so many years, was the reason I understood a little more the context of Tita Cristine&rsquo;s background.</p><p>I remember watching Land Before Time. It was a very immersive film. We watched so many CDs over the years. I cannot believe I &ldquo;lived&rdquo; in those worlds, stuck there, looking around as if it was the only thing there was. We watched the first Land Before Time film all way up to Land Before Time 14, totaling 14 films. We were so happy to find those CDs when we found them in Video City. It was like finding the rarest treasure chest or getting that expensive skin from a lucky box in a video game.</p><ol><li>The Land Before Time (1988)</li><li>The Land Before Time II: The Great Valley Adventure (1994)</li><li>The Land Before Time III: The Time of the Great Giving (1995)</li><li>The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists (1996)</li><li>The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island (1997)</li><li>The Land Before Time VI: The Secret of Saurus Rock (1998)</li><li>The Land Before Time VII: The Stone of Cold Fire (2000)</li><li>The Land Before Time VIII: The Big Freeze (2001)</li><li>The Land Before Time IX: Journey to Big Water (2002)</li><li>The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration (2003)</li><li>The Land Before Time XI: Invasion of the Tinysauruses (2005)</li><li>The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers (2006)</li><li>The Land Before Time XIII: The Wisdom of Friends (2007)</li><li>The Land Before Time XIV: Journey of the Brave (2016)</li></ol><p>I remember the feeling of just watching the first Avengers film again and again. It was one of many films I rewatched a lot.</p><p>I watched Evangelion, and I didn&rsquo;t have much of an opinion on it. I thought, &ldquo;This is the norm, and if not, this quality should be the norm.&rdquo;</p><p>Watching Violet Evergarden on Smart TV made me cry.</p><p>This was the relevant youth camp where I named myself &ldquo;Luke&rdquo; on ID-nickname tag (I was wrong. This is not the one I think. Or maybe Im wrong, yeah I&rsquo;m pretty sure I was younger when I named myself Luke):
RELEVANT: 2016 DISTRICT YOUTH CAMP
JUNE 1-3, 2016
DALUYAN COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTER
NAIC, CAVITE</p><p>I remember the painting of the flags on that fabric, the chanting. After looking at the video, I learned that I was wearing a blue graphic tee with a red jacket that didn&rsquo;t quite reach my waist. I was holding a microphone and presenting the banner or flag that said Allegiant. It was a shield with wings and a cross on top and a Bible below it. The cross&rsquo;s horizontal line was bent to the left. The shield read with the words superimposed on one another: &ldquo;Deuteronomy 31:6&rdquo;</p><p>I saw a video from this youth camp where that one well-known chubby-looking singer was singing Wake (You will never fade away) by Hillsong United. The video showed jumping.</p><p>Dance-jumping was a frequent thing I did. I remember jumping so much in another camp in Baguio that my glasses fell. However, it didn&rsquo;t break or get trampled on. I thought it was a divine intervention and even spoke with newfound amazement when I mentioned it.</p><p>I also remember YOUTH CAMP 2017 Zambales. The theme was &ldquo;Dead End&rdquo; I bought a blue shirt with the theme name from there.</p><p>By the way, the cottage that my parents&rsquo; client and where we stayed was in front of Baguio Country Club.</p><p>In 2017, I still believed in God. My mother sent me a message with a picture from when we attended D&rsquo;Cup&rsquo;s Project S.A.L.T. monthly meeting. I was wearing a red shirt and still had the wristband Ate Faye gave me.</p><p>From the pictures, at the Baguio (I think) camp, we were wearing IDs with blue lanyards. In Relevant youth camp, we wore IDs with black lanyards.</p><p>I remember the &ldquo;Ekonec&rdquo; shirts we wore at Concert at paranaque city (OBEY YOUR THIRST). It might have been during this time that I spoke to that girl from the church network who told me not to be indecisive.</p><p>The concert was held on SUN, AUG 28, 2016: &ldquo;Zone 2 - Obey Your Thirst&rdquo;</p><p>The well-known chubby-looking singer girl&rsquo;s name was Shimei</p><p>I remember that our Dad didn&rsquo;t always go to our original church and that we were trying to get him to go. We were hoping that he would &ldquo;come into terms with God.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember going to Manila historical place where I used Dad&rsquo;s Iphone (maybe Iphone 5) to take pictures and uploaded one of those pictures of myself to wordpress.</p><p>In that historical place, cliffs were sharply cut, and grass and moss was everywhere. The sky and atmosphere was gray in color, and the greenery was more of a &ldquo;Olive Drab&rdquo; color. It is a dark yellowish-green shade that resembles the color of olive tree foliage. #96955E specifically (based on color pricker in operating system Windows&rsquo; Paint (not paint.net) application after pressing Print Screen keyboard button with one of the photos from when we went to the historical place in display)</p><p>One of the pictures set at our home in 501D around the year when we went to that historical place showed me and my siblings sitting at a table in the living room. We still had blue, plastic plates at the time and these white cups that had colored graphics on them. Around this time, David showed himself to be the type to have his shirt off. It was also around this time that we had the white tablet, not the black, aforementioned tablet. This white tablet was on the familiar round table in the picture. We also had the &ldquo;high-tech&rdquo; land-line telephone thing that we got from relatives on Dad&rsquo;s side I think. We used to have a black land-line telephone. I mean &ldquo;telephone&rdquo; by the one where you put it down and if you don&rsquo;t, you hear a ringing. In the picture, we also had yellow blocks, not lego. Blocks.</p><p>We also went to play badminton at this one place that I don&rsquo;t recall. In a picture set during one of these badminton sessions, Aaron, who was GB&rsquo;s brother, me, Ate Danielle, David, who was my half-brother, James Carl, and Kuya Glenn, Ate Danielle&rsquo;s boyfriend who had been with us for a long time.</p><p>We went multiple times to that badminton place, as I see another picture of myself wearing a different shirt. Although this is most likely because I changed shirt in the same session.</p><p>The aforementioned historical place where we went was also where and when we took the picture that we still have on frame.</p><p>I remember that girl from the one of two daughter churches of our original church. She liked me, and now, I saw her in a picture where I was in a sports event. I was wearing my old NCA sports shorts and some blue sports shirt.</p><p>In another photo, I was wearing a pull string bag during either another or the same sports event. I was beside James Josh (Badjoy) and David. Ate Danielle was sitting down far back in the picture.</p><p>I saw a picture of myself and the youth group from the original church: Timothy, who was my youngest brother, Kuya Glenn, Ate Danielle, Kuya Paulo, who was my oldest half-brother, Kuya Mark, Ate Faye, Kuya Dhan, the person who was selling ice scream to us, and some dude that I don&rsquo;t know in the back.</p><p>I saw a picture of my older half-brother, David, in National Student Convention. He&rsquo;s next to a familiar face whom I only saw on Facebook. Further back, a woman that I was also in the same school as was there.</p><p>I saw a picture showing another sports event that I had forgotten where we wore red. This was probably a team game with yellow, green, ect., involving the original church and its two daughter churches</p><p>I saw a picture where I was holding a guitar in a elevator next to my half-sister, Ate Danielle, Kuya Glenn, and Kuya Paulo. I believe we were heading to Team Ministries.</p><p>I saw another picture where we were at the beach and I was wearing a black swim shirt with a dead fish logo. I don&rsquo;t remember this.</p><p>I saw another picture where I was sitting down holding a guitar wearing blue denim pants, a white polo, and holding the nilon guitar, next to JM, my best friend at the time.</p><p>I saw another picture where I was wearing a red Dark Vader shirt with that desert-colored shorts. I was doing a pose, sitting next to Badjoy in the original church.</p><p>I remember the chairs that were used as chairs for NCA at first, but after NCA was gone, it became a symbol of the chairs we used for after church services where we would sit and eat.</p><p>I saw another picture where I was singing in the original church. Standing, I was playing the guitar that Tito Joel gave me. I was next to Kuya Glenn. Further to the side, my mother was singing. Furthest from me, my half-sister was playing on the piano and singing.</p><p>In the picture, many electric fans were scattered around.</p><p>I remember attending one session of the Believers&rsquo; Conference that had Dr. Roberts Liardon as a guest speaker at Team Ministries. December 2 - 4, 2016. The hosts were Bishop Tony Marioghae& Dr. Ernaida Marioghae and Bishop Ricardo Sio& Hon. Beth Sio.</p><p>TEAM Alabang used to be located at 12th floor, Common Goal Tower, Finance Road, Madrigal Business Park, Ayala-Alabang Muntinlupa City, but I believe they moved to a larger building.</p><p>I saw another picture where one thing I remember is the appearance of the older sister of my best friend JM. Her name&rsquo;s Ardy, and it was around this time that I begun to think that she looked pretty. Not to the point of crushing over her, but I thought that she looked pretty.</p><p>I was wearing glasses in the picture compared to the previous pictures.</p><p>I remember and saw in the picture the colored, plastic cups and the orange juice glass bottles with colored, plastic straws.</p><p>I was wearing a Hornets shirt that I got from the event with Dad&rsquo;s co-workers that I attended with Dad.</p><p>One of the pictures showed that I had gone to a store in ATC. I don&rsquo;t remember why, but maybe Jeremiah was there because we often went to ATC together.</p><p>I saw another picture where I was outside in Filinvest because I had gone walking and exercising with my parents.</p><p>I saw a picture where I got my glasses finally at 14 years old at Own Days.</p><p>In another picture, where me and my parents went to Tagaytay I believe, we were sitting down, and I was wearing the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Not Lucky I&rsquo;m Blessed&rdquo; shirt made by the Youth at my original church.</p><p>I remember my eldest half-brother lying on the phone regarding the situation at home. I don&rsquo;t remember why and what, but I remember that he did.</p><p>I remember my brother Peter getting a short hand of the stick when it came to my eldest half-brother Kuya Paulo.</p><p>I remember being a clumsy kid.</p><p>I saw another picture (after skipping some pictures) of when we were hiking. One of the pictures showed this result:
a person walking on a trail in tall grass (0.45%)
a person with a backpack running through tall grass (0.45%)
a blue sky above a grassy hill (0.35%)
a close-up of a dirt path (0.44%)
a group of people walking on a trail (0.55%)
a blue backpack on a person&rsquo;s arm (0.48%)
a close-up of a tree (0.48%)
a person&rsquo;s foot in the mud (0.42%)
a group of people walking on a trail (0.51%)
a green hill with blue sky (0.34%)</p><p>The last few years from 2018 to 2023 have been spent understanding the Internet much better. It&rsquo;s not like I haven&rsquo;t been using the Internet before, but it&rsquo;s only recently that I got a personal computer and began to scour the Internet. I struggled with depression, going to the gym, learning how to eat healthy, getting sick, struggling with emotions, trying many things, reading many things, exploring many things on the Internet. This taught me a lot about how the Internet is like compared to when I was going to computer shops playing video games with friends. This was me exploring by myself and seeing how me, as an individual can get to know the world around me through the lens of the Internet.</p><p>I consumed manga, books, webtoons, videos, an-ime, films, ect. It was my time to delve into a more well-rounded understanding of my circumstances. It came at the cost of forgetting my past, but now, since I&rsquo;m piecing together my past through pictures and through remembering, I can bring together these two parts of my life and hopefully get a more well-rounded result.</p><p>Of course, the pictures alone don&rsquo;t capture everything. I know there&rsquo;s so much that haven&rsquo;t been captured on camera, and if they had, I didn&rsquo;t upload them online and instead deleted them. I could have uploaded them, but I didn&rsquo;t really understanding the Internet, data, and time passing. It was these past five years that taught me about the changing world around me and the manifold experiences everyone has.</p><p>Traveling and meeting manifold persons outside before heading to the Internet as an individual was crucial to maintaining a concrete perspective of others despite the exaggeration of things on the Internet.</p><p>It is with these two perspectives that I now gain the strength to move forward as an individual of the world through and through and through the communication tool of the Internet.</p><p>I remember seeing the horse video where they were showing military equipment and then they had military attire for the horse. Great marketing!</p><p>ColorNote was the application I used to write the story &ldquo;The Forge of Brothers.&rdquo; I was so bad at writing down the complexities that I had experienced throughout all those years.</p><p>Now, I&rsquo;m doing a stream of consciouss approach because this is the easiest since I&rsquo;m struggling with remembering and I want to be able to write it down as soon as I remember. However, the grammar lessons that I&rsquo;ve learned are still there. Though I clearly don&rsquo;t obey them in this book. I move between past and present tense a lot.</p><p>I wrote many books that I didn&rsquo;t end up uploading on wattpad. I enjoyed the &ldquo;What Do I Want&rdquo; book that I wrote and felt that it accurately documented the perspective that I had as per the limitations of the tool of writing and writing fiction.</p><p>Speaking of The Forge of Brothers, there was much reference to League of Legends since I enjoyed the mechanics that the game provided, seeing it as the best way to write &ldquo;LitRPG.&rdquo; Of course, I only learned of the term &ldquo;LitRPG&rdquo; a few years ago. It was during 2016 that I wrote The Forge of Brothers, and I probably learned of &ldquo;LitRPG&rdquo; around 2020 or 2019 probably.</p><p>I remember making Minecraft Servers and tested around on Bukkit. It was only recently that I began my own Minecraft server that I used a viewer SMP on 2021 I believe. It was centered around playing survival alongside Twitch viewers. I enjoyed it and got success quite early within only two weeks I believe—15 viewers at max (not average viewers just viewers). It wasn&rsquo;t that successful, but for someone who had been getting 0 viewers for so long. Finally getting a chance to have more than 0 average viewers was crazy. I struggled somewhat toward the end of that attempt at streaming and handling the viewer SMP. I remember a few usernames, Sprutnutt and Panda. I forgot the rest, but I remember the couple who would often whisper to one another. I remember that I thought there was a lag machine but it was the plugin that I downloaded. I didn&rsquo;t want to believe it was them, but as time raced, I began to doubt. Of course, I found out before my doubts were revealed. I downloaded, tested, and experimented with many Spigot plugins. I even got a suggestion from the guy part of the aforementioned couple. I remember a dude with &ldquo;brown&rdquo; in his username who was very edgy. He would try to provoke me in the game, blocking where my pickaxe mined in order to prevent me from mining. I was trying hard not to get provoked. It was frustrating, and I would often vent out my frustrations after the stream. I was testing new lights at the time, and I wasn&rsquo;t used to it. I was also forcing myself to stay up and try to stream at night instead of day because most people were from America and had that kind of schedule. I was losing sleep, using new very lights that made my eyes hurt, managing the discord server, managing the plugins, managing being the admin in the server, dealing with an admin that cheated his way in the game, playing the actual Minecraft game, reading chat, trying not to get anxious over numbers, and being conflicted over whether to ban edgy jokes or not as some of my audience, who were subsequently also the Minecrafters who played in the viewer SMP server, were children. I even tested a very difficult mode with the help of command blocks that made mobs overpowered. A viewer with &ldquo;Zombie&rdquo; in his username liked it, but no one else did. At a few points after the server was ended, I would look back and wonder what would have happened if I kept the very difficult mode. In the end, it was possible to beat this mode easily if you played PVP for a while.</p><p>Now, I believe that the server would die sooner or later due to my burnout.</p><p>Nowadays, I don&rsquo;t stream as much. I still have one of the viewers, who became the corrupt admin at one point, Sprutnutt in my discord friend list.</p><p>I remember I was so happy just having the server and seeing people so supportive once the server failed to handle the many people. I then switched from &ldquo;Spig-ot&rdquo; to &ldquo;PaperMC&rdquo;, which made it so much faster. My Dad also increased the capacity of the &ldquo;AWS&rdquo; lightsail server to handle the many players. It was up to 15 players in the server if I remember correctly.</p><p>I remember this player, who I assumed to be trans, was fun to play with because they were very immersed in the server, which I enjoyed a lot. I think her username started with &ldquo;N&rdquo;.</p><p>The person who subscribed to my channel twice. He had this weird long username, but it was something like user3513515 or something. I forgot his old username. &ldquo;user3513515&rdquo; might be wrong. His current username is &ldquo;blakeriley16&rdquo;. He built tall structures that I enjoyed a lot. I remember that he said that he watched manifold livestreams in a discord call. He was British I think.</p><p>There was this girl whose username had &ldquo;Happy&rdquo; in her name that was also a part of the server. I remember just feeling that so many things were happening. There was the &ldquo;Boost&rdquo; that I implemented where if you use your &ldquo;Channel Points&rdquo; on Twitch to redeem the &ldquo;Boost,&rdquo; it would give everyone a boost in mining speed and movement speed or something. Maybe even regeneration. I don&rsquo;t remember.</p><p>I remember Happy&rsquo;s brother was not amused at the server after Happy asked me if her brother could join.</p><p>I remember &ldquo;Unknown,&rdquo; one of the first viewers of my channel. I remember that he joined while I was in a swamp just building wooden slabs to cover the water in the swamp. Maybe it was someone else.</p><p>I remember that I was trying to act theatrically and then had Unknown join. It was also at that time that I got a 50-or-something–viewer raid and just felt like improvising. It was during this time that I met unknown I think, or maybe it was someone else.</p><p>I remember the dude with &ldquo;brown&rdquo; in his username being so edgy to the point of saying that griefing was his way of experiencing power or something.</p><p>The username of my Twitch account was &ldquo;trialog&rdquo; at first, then &ldquo;yoksikan&rdquo;, and then finally &ldquo;yokseekan&rdquo;. I remember Sprutnutt telling me that he remembered when I was still trialog later on.</p><p>I remember that he said that he felt guilty regarding being corrupt and that he was the reason why I struggled with livestreaming later on or something. He said it multiple times, similar to James Josh Frias apologizing about how he let go of the swing and let it swing down and against my forehead at the park of Agro Homes Subd.</p><p>The fact that it only lasted 2 months and had a big effect on psyche is because of how out of my comfort zone it was.</p><p>According to Twitch, the &ldquo;Estimated Net Balance&rdquo; of my account &ldquo;Yokseekan&rdquo; is &ldquo;$35.48&rdquo;</p><p>\section*{Titles in my &ldquo;Activity&rdquo; section in Twitch &ldquo;Dashboard&rdquo;}

\twocolumn
I remember reading this manga &lsquo;Non-biri VRMMO-ki,&rsquo; remembering the weird chat group characters. I enjoyed it because the characters were cute, but I stopped reading it after a while, maybe because I read up to the latest chapter.</p><p>I loved this manga &ldquo;Isekai Nonbiri Nouka.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know why, but it&rsquo;s such a strong fantasy manga for me because it just leans into it totally. It&rsquo;s not super immersive, but it does everything that a brain who wants to fantasize with all the simple joys it offers.</p><p>I remember feeling that Ram, a friend, was good at AWP in Crossfire Online.</p><p>I remember when David told me about rushing in CS:GO (Counter Strike: Global Offensive) with the P90 gun.</p><p>I remember when I played Counter Strike and\ Counter Strike Source. I enjoyed Counter Strike Source for some reason. I remember feeling that Counter Strike felt too old, but I still played many times with friends. Counter Strike 1.5 maybe not as much. I played Counter Strike Source the most.</p><p>I remember when I was walking through a resort once, hearing the loud noise of the numerous people in manifold pools. I remember passing by the sides of pools and just seeing these monkey bars. I don&rsquo;t remember why I was there, but I distinctly remember the image of those monkey bars and the feeling of just being one among many strangers with their own groups.</p><p>I remember when my family would bring containers with brown rice to KFC. We&rsquo;ve gone to KFC so many times. We just poured the unlimited gravy over the rice and ate it with the chicken. We were good at eating lots of rice, or maybe it was just me.</p><p>I remember when we bought the beatbox that I have right now. It&rsquo;s so useful for so many things besides beatbox, and I didn&rsquo;t end up learning it much. I still want to make a channel surrounded around making beatbox music. I feel that such a thing would contribute to the beatbox community.</p><p>I learned that one of the pictures was taken in Enchanted Kingdom with a large tree. I don&rsquo;t remember this.</p><p>The sections of my life could be divided as follows:</p><ol><li>Watching many films like Land Before Time as a child</li><li>going to NCA, which was a grand experience in itself with a variety of different social and relational dynamics. If you include field trips and the fact that cheating, scoring your work, and getting special privileges if you were exceptional were present, then it was a very complex environment.</li><li>going to Quezon and traveling somewhat.</li><li>Meeting relatives rarely</li><li>Enjoying myself with people from the original church where NCA was located.</li><li>going to the national student competition and to the bible competition.</li><li>Watching movies and eating outside with family</li><li>DVBS, resorts, ect. with original church.</li><li>Attending NCA with Teacher Ruth. Classmates with Xyrelle. I remember how the classroom looked like. I remember tracing letters in the textbook. It took a long time for even me to learn language.</li><li>Going to BGC to visit.</li><li>and it goes on&mldr;</li></ol><p>I remember watching Pewdiepie and thinking that he swore too much.</p><p>I remember seeing pancit canton being mixed with rice often at the original church.</p><p>Just a while ago, as of writing, I had a dream about superpowers.</p><p>They beat me and my brother Timothy (or Peter) badly, so they went and refilled our water with cold ones. These people seemed to be people that looked like Jhon Peter.</p><p>I remember that it was like superpowers, and we were fighting several different people.</p><p>I remember two enemy supers (individuals with superpowers).</p><p>I remember that we shot one of them dead. And I tried to punch the other one. I tried to follow, but they flew top fast.</p><p>I was undeterred, looking like a stern superman as I levitated a few feet down to the ground.</p><p>I remember the scared faces of the one I was about to punch.</p><p>I remember that they underestimated us.</p><p>I think I had a false wake up where I went downstairs and saw them as they entered our house afterwards to refill our water. I&rsquo;m not sure.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know how they beat my brother or me. I don&rsquo;t remember, but I remember an image depicting the face of my brother against the ground, taking up the whole view. His right eye was open, but a stout slash went over his face. His left eye was either closed or didn&rsquo;t appear to be there.</p><p>I remember we were fighting in a city with no civilians that I remember.</p><p>I remember the person who escaped because they flew too fast for me. They were a bright light that disappeared in the horizon</p><p>I remember that I was seeing myself often from afar. Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t even me. I saw myself from afar when I levitated a few feet to the ground.</p><p>I remember when the people who refilled our water with cold water went inside our house back and forth from the screen door to the dining room-kitchen. They might have been bringing gifts, but I don&rsquo;t remember.</p><p>I remember that they were scared that we might retaliate. (Or maybe it was an assumption I made in the dream.)</p><p>I remember the hairstyle of the person who flew too fast and the feeling of punching her. I remember her scared face,and the lumpy feeling of punching her. I felt like I was punching mochi the same way Japanese chefs (or something similar) pound mochi.</p><p>She had pinkish-red hair. The top of her hair was white while the bottom of both her strands at her left and right were black. However, it might have been light (highlight) and shadow. a hairstyle like the &ldquo;Virtual Youtuber&rdquo; Ange Katrina but with much less bangs and more pink hair. &ldquo;Virtual Youtuber&rdquo; is a Youtube creator with a virtual avatar.</p><p>I wrote &ldquo;we&rdquo; against enemies regarding my dream. I don&rsquo;t who &ldquo;we&rdquo; was because I only remember seeing me. However, I&rsquo;m very sure that it was &ldquo;we&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;I.&rdquo;</p><p>I was punching this super that looked like Ange Katrina on the ground. I don&rsquo;t remember where we shot the other one.</p><p>I remember that it was one of the people with me who shot the other one. Maybe it was Timothy or Peter. I&rsquo;m not sure.</p><p>The people who were refilling our water looked much different from the supers we fought, but I recognized them as being in the same group as the enemy supers. I also remember them talking about something, but I don&rsquo;t remember. I remember that they numbered 10 or above 10.</p><p>I saw one person who looked like Jhon Peter wearing a black shirt and what I surmise to be gray pants or pajamas or something equally long. Maybe the long undergarment had a hint of blue.</p><p>After seeing a video in my recommendation, the girl super in my dream actually looks like the Virtual Youtuber Lui (Holo X) rather than Ange Katrina.</p><p>I remember having a dream about that girl from MCA, Ashley, while she was wearing her uniform. I don&rsquo;t remember much, but I had many dreams that included her and—well—most people from my school. I don&rsquo;t know why specifically, but I had an assumption. I remember that she had this look that I presumed over the course of a few months to be infatuation. I didn&rsquo;t think much of it while she had that persistent look because I didn&rsquo;t like her at all. I was very specific with who I liked, and I was sure when I did because I felt it so strongly as soon as I did get that feeling of infatuation with someone else. I think recognizing that such a person who looked like a model based on appearance, which meant that they probably took care of themselves well, could even consider me as someone that they would even like even a little. This is what surprised me and made me curious about how people perceive me, which was probably why I had dreams about her. I was wondering why people would look at me that way, especially considering my changing perception of myself. In a way, having her in my dreams provided me with a symbol of that discrepansy or gap in understanding of myself.</p><p>I remember inviting Aidan, Andrei, and even \ Robyn, three of whom were classmates from MCA, I think to the New Life Church. \They came, and they looked quite—hmm—curious and a little daunted while there. It was a big church after all. After the service—I don&rsquo;t remember what the service, maybe some youth or prayer service—they told me to come back. This was a few months after I quit school due to burnout. I gave them a noncommital answer, and we parted ways.</p><p>I remember learning that Kuya Mark liked my sister while we were standing in the original church. This was the point that the flag was gone, although the flag was gone for a long time by that time. I think I was the one who asked Kuya Mark, or maybe not. This was also many years after I met him. It was probably around 2016, 2017, 2018 or something.</p><p>I remember having a dream where I went on stage after reading a script or something and then spoke in front of my MCA classmates. This stage and place looked much different from stage in MCA.</p><p>&ldquo;Piss off screw you&rdquo; is a made-up phrase that I say to refer to something that is very aggravating. (Ex. This is such a &ldquo;piss off screw you&rdquo; moment. This is so &ldquo;piss off screw you!&rdquo;)</p><p>&ldquo;Shitting on my grave&rdquo; is a made-up phrase that I say to refer to when someone or something is insulting me. (Ex. This guy is &ldquo;shitting on my grave.&rdquo;)</p><p>I remember the feeling of going to the original church while it rained. I remember the feeling of coming home many times with an umbrella. I remember the feeling of heading to MCA with an umbrella. I remember the appearance of the original church and the color tones that pervaded the scene from the viewpoint near the gate and next to the large portico. I remember the faces of various children and the silhouette forms of their parents further ahead who were gathered in between two buildings. These two buildings were comprised of the former classroom of the upper grades of NCA that had become a storage room and the building where the staff of the original church cooked many times. This cooking building was connected to the house of the pastor&rsquo;s family. It had much history, as it used to be one whole. Now, it consisted of two parts after the placing of a wall in between.</p><p>The former classroom building, which I will call &ldquo;Building A,&rdquo; was situated to the left when looking from the gates of the church grounds. The cooking building, which I will call &ldquo;Building B,&rdquo; was situated to the right. Its two parts were facing Building A. These two parts used to have doors. Building B was next to a set of comfort rooms. These comfort rooms had signs, but they used to have a sign hanging by a ceiling right before you turned the corner to sight them. This ceiling was part of the roof and tubular, partially hollow pillar that was connected to Building A.</p><p>Landscaping garden mint-colored</p><p>I remember seeing beyond the barbed wires atop the walls connected to the landscaping garden thing and thinking of a bigger world out there.</p><p>I remember the wooden plants that have remained below the naked or exposed faucet with blue tubes and a plus-sign–shaped handle next to Building A.</p><p>I remember the corrugated metal of the interconnected roof in between Building A and B. I remember the rain pattering against this crimson red and gray roof with hints of orange. The loud sound of the pattering was clear when you were sitting down and relaxing underneath beside the mint-colored tables and black chairs.</p><p>These chairs were various in color and design: black, white, and brown.</p><p>I live and then I die, crushed under a mighty storm.</p><p>I remember my mother throwing a shoe at me when we are at the old house rather than our current house as of writing, 501D. She was angry, and I was crying.</p><p>She was expressed regret over this matter a few times, especially since I began to exhibit episodes of anger.</p><p>I remember going home from Novaliches, where I went to camp. I remember holding an image of a rectangular horizontal form that read &ldquo;11 years old.&rdquo; I remember liking two girls there—Crystal and another one that I don&rsquo;t remember.</p><p>I remember seeing this taller dude, someone who was in my team, in the room that I was staying in. He was probably sleeping in the same room along with two or three or more other people.</p><p>I remember that I didn&rsquo;t have a super favorable relationship with him.</p><p>When I left the camp, I remember going home alongside Crystal and parting ways. Crystal had a \ guardian I believe. I was with Mom and probably Peter and Timothy.</p><p>I remember being convinced to sing and that made me want to start singing.</p><p>My life was very simple back then, but they had rippling effects on my life. Of course, with the careful care of my original church, I started singing more and more, starting inside the bathroom at home at 501D.</p><p>In the camp, the team name was &ldquo;Hope,&rdquo; and I learned that we were chanting it.</p><p>I realized that me being Chinese and the way that I carried myself and spoke affected the way people perceived me.</p><p>Names that I should remember from the camp:</p><p>Elyca Cayanan,
Charlotte Tongol,
Crystal Jat,
Abbie Ceron (old account),
Aby Crn (new account),
Joshua Masbad,
Elaine Mae Duremdes Panela,
Stephen \Matthew Moris Felonia,</p><p>Crystal Jat used to Crystal Jatayna or something. Her brother is Zack Jatayna in case she dips out of Facebook. She looks like the type to do</p><p>Abbie was 14 years old at the time of the camp. I thought she would be much older, but I realize now that it makes sense because it was a youth camp after all.</p><p>From the pictures, I also looked much different than I expected.</p><p>Stephen was the one who listened to me talk for an hour or something I think, and that talk helped me understand the world better. I felt so grateful to him.</p><p>I remember when he asked me if my smile was genuine.</p><p>Even though I didn&rsquo;t really understand what I was saying, I said that it wasn&rsquo;t.</p><p>He said something along the lines of &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t smile if it&rsquo;s not genuine then!&rdquo;</p><p>I think the youth camp was the earliest that I remember, but I do believe I went to a camp not as an attendee but accompanying my mother who was a speaker often.</p><p>I got some pictures by Abbie Ceron from the camp. Fortunately, Elyca Cayanan commented on a photo including my youngest brother Timothy.</p><p>In 2016, I was still using the VAOI laptop.</p><p>I remember reading this book &ldquo;Super Minion&rdquo; and finding it quite revolutionary.</p><p>I remember reading this book &ldquo;Everybody Loves Large Chests&rdquo; and finding it so vivid and immersive.</p><p>I remember reading this book &ldquo;Perfect Run&rdquo; and finding that interactions so interesting. Although I\ stopped reading.</p><p>I failed to finish &ldquo;Super Minion&rdquo; too. It had a slow release.</p><p>why do I feel like I&rsquo;ve only gained self-awareness now after taking many years to process my constant exposure to rich, fulfilling, manifold, diverse, various, far-reaching experiences.</p><p>The thing is&mldr; in every one of those experiences, I was stuck in a small world. Each of those experiences were like a world of their own. When I entered into one of these experiences, I forgot the rest and focused on relevant details.</p><p>It&rsquo;s only recently that I started to process all the &ldquo;worlds&rdquo; that I experienced and see them as belonging to one whole—me.</p><p>It scares me rather because I don&rsquo;t want to believe that I lacked self-awareness when I was younger, or I was not conscious or alive. I was alive and breathing. I had concerns, and I was young, trying to understand the world around me. The complexities of the world suddenly started to make sense as time passed. Now, what I used to consider complex are now boringly simple.</p><p>I remember that when I was younger, I used to remember hearing that I was not allowed to eat street food. This means that I most likely didn&rsquo;t eat that much street food and only ate at home. If ever I traveled at night, it was travelin rather than going out to eat food.</p><p>I&rsquo;m happy I don&rsquo;t have to deal with the potential consequences of eating street food.</p><p>If the camp was 2014, then that means that was already 1 year before I made a roblox account and 2 years before I made a wordpress account where I posted my story &ldquo;The Forge of Brothers.&rdquo; The timeline is a little strange to me and contradictory to my past understanding of it. This means that 2014, 2015, 2016 were very weighty in my development.</p><p>It&rsquo;s only recently I started going &ldquo;meta&rdquo; or self-aware of my past and everything that I did. So, the past five years have been me looking at &ldquo;meta&rdquo; media and understanding the world around me and how they perceived many things. Even 2021 was a year where I spoke in a weird manner in Discord private messages. I had this semi-formal way of speaking that came across as weird and not charismatic to me.</p><p>The characteristics that I associate strongly with myself right now were pretty recent, which means I have become very adaptable to changing times.</p><p>This is why I&rsquo;ve begun to write my autobiography, employing Facebook, old photos, and the study of the profile of old friends in the process.</p><p>Even if time feels like it had passed very quickly since 2020, I have experienced, experimented, and learned a lot about myself and the world around me.</p><p>I remember the Facebook games Backyard Monsters, Stick Run, Pet Society and enjoying them each, spending a good sum of time playing them.</p><p>I still remember the dancing of the Pet Society characters.</p><p>I still remember the scamming in Stick Run.</p><p>And I still remember the variety of monsters after checking out the Backyard Monsters wiki.</p><p>I remember the satisfying feeling of having the buildings in Backyard Monsters. The cannon tower and the mortar give me good, satisfied feelings.</p><p>I remember playing Moshi Monsters. I think I remember paying for something in it.</p><p>I still remember Rox in Moshi Monsters and how it felt having it.</p><p>I remembered the planting of the seeds mechanic after seeing it in a video.</p><p>I remember that we bought Moshi Monsters Moshlings, or just Moshlings. I don&rsquo;t remember where, but I and my siblings enjoyed it that much.</p><p>I remember playing the Icecream game in Moshi Monsters. That was a satisfying feeling.</p><p>I remember Moshi Monster&rsquo;s music video Lady Goo Goo&rsquo;s &lsquo;&lsquo;The Moshi Dance&rsquo;&rsquo;. I also remember Moptop Tweenybop (My Hair&rsquo;s Too Long).</p><p>The others:
&ldquo;The Missy Kix Dance&rdquo;
Blingo &ldquo;Diggin&rsquo; Ya Lingo&rdquo;
Dr. Strangeglove&rsquo;s Music Video
Uptown Fifi!
The IGGY Chomp
I Heart Moshlings
ponies!</p><p>I remember the Puzzle Palace game in Moshi Monsters.</p><p>I remember the redemption of codes.</p><p>It was closed in 2019, which was 4 years ago as of writing. 2019 felt like such an infant time of my life, yet clearly I had enough time and years to play Moshi Monsters to feel like I&rsquo;ve played for a long while.</p><p>I played Club Penguins as well.</p><p>I remember wishing I got better puffles (pet character in Club Penguins) since I believe I had the default puffle color. I believe each puffle had their own personalities.</p><p>I remember the pizza mechanic in Club Penguin, finding it enjoyable at the time.</p><p>I remember the first computer shop I went to. It was either the one in soldiers or visiting some random computer shop while traveling before that.</p><p>I remember vividly now that I played in a remote computer shop away from home with someone—John Michael Luis Velasco. I think I was playing Renekton at the time. Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong. I feel distinctly that I was playing Renekton, but maybe I&rsquo;m mixing up my memories.</p><p>I remember playing in a computer shop with my cousin Jeremiah and some friend at the time—Kiana Alegado.</p><p>I remember some of Jeremiah&rsquo;s friends—Craig Lam Ramos, Alexandra, and Rachelle and her sister. \Jeremiah apparently aren&rsquo;t friends with Rachelle and her sister and Alexandra, anymore, and I can guess why from my recollections. Rachelle used to be his girlfriend I believe, and he moved away, which made being friends Alexandra difficutl. I remember other friends of Jeremiah, but I forgot their names.</p><p>I remember National Prayer Gathering. I believe I went to the 30th one at 2019. I remember sitting at the bleachers, which is the cheapest seat you could get, at one point before I began to stay at the court itself, probably the most or second to most expensive ticket seat. This was with the help of Tita Maris (Maria John).</p><p>I think I remember going to the Feast of Tabernacles in 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019.</p><p>I remember going to the 29th National Prayer Gathering.</p><p>The name of the girl I liked before, one of the Praise and Worship Team at these National Prayer Gatherings, is Tanja De Guzman. She doesn&rsquo;t even have a Facebook account, which shows the kind of person she is. Although I did see a Facebook account with a profile picture from 2011. So that must have been her.</p><p>I remember the feeling of getting those plastic food containers in those National Prayer Gatherings—the satisfying feeling of being able to eat even if it was hotdog.</p><p>I remember the feeling of walking down the sides at the court to head to the bathroom. The feeling of manifold experiences happening at the same time was immense.</p><p>I remember when Jeremiah and I went to buy food\—the smell of the food and the hunger that I felt was visceral.</p><p>The variety of smells as well of different people was not unknown to me. I had gone to many events, churches, and met manifold persons, which made the smell of gatherings quite distinctly clear to me.</p><p>I remember the feeling of the seats at the side rows and the cup holder where I would place water bottles I believe in Araneta Coliseum during National Prayer Gathering. I don&rsquo;t remember which one.</p><p>I remember distinctly that this place was also where I went with MCA. I remember being given a small pair of scissors to trim my moustache because it wasn&rsquo;t allowed to have ugly moustache to enter or something like that.</p><p>The livestreams of National Prayer Gatherings are on Facebook. The 30th one was the one where I got the picture of Tanja. I still have it, and as of writing, I&rsquo;m trying to find where I got the picture on the Facebook page of Intercessors for the Philippines Inc. Watching the livestreams doesn&rsquo;t beat actually being there though.</p><p>I saw videos by other people of Crystal Jatayna on Youtube, they&rsquo;re from 2015 where she was either dancing or singing.</p><p>Ate Danielle, my sister, has many photos of me, but since I and my Mom traveled to events a lot and didn&rsquo;t really take pictures, there is a great gap in documentation.</p><p>Additionally, the technological gap at the time was clear, as my mother was using a Nokia phone for a long time.</p><p>I remember taking an acting class from this dude who looked like an older Michael Jackson from the way he acted, dressed, and styled his hair. It didn&rsquo;t really make it any better necessarily, but it did teach me about a new kind of environment for acting, which was zoom calls. Acting in real life needed actual constant practice in real life, and being able to film myself was essential to get this to feel like the genuine product.</p><p>I remember a girl from that Zoom acting class there who looked fancy. She dressed and acted like a &ldquo;lady,&rdquo; which I soon realized was because of her older sister and mother that appeared on screen at one point I think</p><p>I remember having therapy sessions with my therapist Dave on Zoom as well, and it wasn&rsquo;t the best experience. This was after the lockdown, and I reallly preferred the offline sessions. I really was an extrovert through and through in the sense that I enjoyed traveling, face-to-face interactions, and going to crowded events.</p><p>I think I felt jealous of Crystal just last night as of writing because she had these really nice pictures of her in a cosplay costume with a nice set and nice photographic quality. It&rsquo;s hilarious that I don&rsquo;t feel attracted. Rather, I feel like I want to do the things she does. I want to do cosplay. I want to sing on stage in places other than church events and camps. I want to sing in anime conventions or something. I want to look pretty and very neat. I think that&rsquo;s why anime has always looked pleasant. It&rsquo;s meant to be this super focused look that trims away things that don&rsquo;t catch the eye. I really want to dress neatly everyday. The way I dress now matches more of a blend between casual and dark academia I think, but I want something more frivolous.</p><p>I really want to master how to make clothes, draw, write, dance, and sing, among others. Even if I&rsquo;ve spent 9 years singing, I still have more to try and learn within the scope of everything else I&rsquo;ve learned. It&rsquo;s applying my singing ability well through marketing, knowledge of social media, knowledge of technical equipment, and experience in other necessities such as a clean look, ect., among others.</p><p>I remember crying at my offline therapy sessions in 2019 I believe. I remember being angry at my Dad and feeling betrayed by my mother. I don&rsquo;t remember why. Probably best that I don&rsquo;t think about it. I do know the reasons, but it&rsquo;s going to take a lot of me to delve into that.</p><p>I remember sitting down beside the father of Kuya David Nidea La Madrid on the bench at the portico of my original church, one of the crucial members of the Praise and Worship team. I remember that at that time, he was already lying down a lot. I also distinctly remember his smell. I don&rsquo;t remember what we talked about, but he did have a few things to talk about.</p><p>I remember seeing the mother of David Nidea La Madrid going home along with David. I remember seeing David standing and talking to Jeilla, my friend Badjoy&rsquo;s oldest sister.</p><p>I also didn&rsquo;t cover every webcomic or manga that I&rsquo;ve read only up to the first chapter.</p><p>I remember reading webnovels or novels like Everybody Loves Large Chests, SSS-Class Suicide Hunter, Overgeared, Space Babes, Re:Monster, Legendary Mechanic, Primal Hunter, My Vampire System</p><p>I believe I dropped Re:Monster after 4 chapters or so, Overgeared after hundreds of chapters, Space Babes after around 15 chapters, Legendary Mechanic around 800+ chapters, Primal Hunter after 100+ chapters, My Vampire System after one chapter,</p><p>Sites that I&rsquo;ve visited over the years:</p><p><a href=https://www.minecraftmaps.com>www.minecraftmaps.com</a></p><p><a href=https://www.reddit.com>www.reddit.com</a></p><p><a href=https://www.incredibots.com>www.incredibots.com</a></p><p>www.</p><p>I need to talk about my times in Quezon. I remember the sunlit trees, the grass, and the bright, blinding sun. I remember the deep shadows that the trees made in contrast to the sun rays. I remember the smell of manure. I remember the people at the church which Lola Cecille attended. I remember the various stores and bakeries I saw. I remember the markets and vendor stalls. I remember the</p><p>I remember the metal swing that had two seats opposite to one another and swung in a fixed horizontal back and forth. This seat was set on the dirt within church grounds in front of the side of the original church.</p><p>The field of cement came first and then a flat depression of dirt flanking it with plants. One flank of these depressions of dirt was narrow and full of large plants below the side windows of the church. The other flank was much wider with grass and much more plants, neighboring which was an ugly gray block cement wall.</p><p>This other flank was where the seat was. The seats had an interconnected floor, so they swung together. It looked like a carriage with four bars that held it up at all four corners. It was blue and yellow I believe.</p><p>my old email at Incredibots was\ \url{samuel22@goodepeople.com}</p><p>I had a dream about monsters.</p><p>Monsters. I&rsquo;m in a dark place that looks like an office.</p><p>The Monsters are powerful, and they are scary.</p><p>I remember seeing a video with my face on the left bottom corner of the screen playing the game.</p><p>I remember watching this video and it having chapters. I remember at the end of each chapter, it showed a clip from me playing the game live. I don&rsquo;t remember the original content though.</p><p>When the monster ate the apples it got stronger.</p><p>I remember hiding, and thinking about the fact that these monsters can be programmed to go last place seen.</p><p>The monster looked like a crystal Pokémon creature, but because of the darkness, the realistic, immersive moody lighting, and the threat that the monster posed, it was scary.</p><p>I remember that before this monster, I was trying to fight living objects like brroms or something. I remember using a hook to try to grab these living objects.</p><p>I remember Badjoy, David, Peter, and maybe Ram who was farthest away. I remember that we were at the park of Agro Homes. I remember that we were throwing something circular like a disc or something.</p><p>I remember we were going to throw these discs at large, rectangular, bent objects around 1 meter in length and trying to hit the part of it that would make it flip over. It was bent upward rather than downward, so it looked like a a wide, stretched letter lowercase V.</p><p>I think I remember that the discs were CDs actually.</p><p>I remember that we each had the large rectangular bent object. They were set on the sand at the park playground while we&rsquo;re standing outside of the sand playground. We were on the lowest side of the park near those trees with cracked cement bases. Although in this dream, I didn&rsquo;t turn around to see the cracked bases, but we really were at the park.</p><p>I remember the video, which had my face at the corner and showed the office game with the monsters and living objects, somehow led to me actually being there.</p><p>I remember the feeling of other people were watching the livestream clip part of the video and feeling disappointed over the decisions I took while engaging the game with the creatures.</p><p>I remember that Badjoy and David were saying something.</p><p>I remember leaving a disk for Peter atop the wall of the sandy playground because I realized there were more than enough.</p><p>The disks were all atop this wall in front of each of us.</p><p>In my dream, I think Peter was much shorter than me. Though, in reality, he&rsquo;s very much near my height.</p><p>My bipolar has made me more impulsive and very theatrical and honest (pressured speaking).</p><p>Is it really pressured speaking if I&rsquo;m not running away from my problems and instead facing them by addressing them not necessarily to others but for myself?</p><p>I&rsquo;ve gotten used to having a fluctuating subscriber count due to me experimenting and testing boundaries to see how people would react and either disprove or confirm my guesses. The fluctuation is mostly positive with more subscribers gained than lost; however, it would be best to focus on retaining subscribers. The best thing I can think off is creating focused branding. It can start off messy to get myself making uploading videos a habit, but dividing the various kinds of videos I make to various channels should ease the tensions caused by a crowdedness or a lack of isolation.</p><p>Of course, the best thing a person can do is try to be comfortable while learning, which sometimes doesn&rsquo;t align with viewers&rsquo; expectations. This is fine by me.</p><p>I am consistently experimenting, so that helps with making it easier for viewers not to get surprised.</p><p>I remember having a dream where Ashley was \standing. I can remember what the image looked like. She was standing on the right side of the image. She was tilted slightly to the left. She was wearing the school uniform I saw her in for most of the school year. The background was black probably with hints of other colors like brown.</p><p>I remember the various items of the refrigerator which we have at home as of writing. I remember the pictures and how it used to be bigger and then smaller and then bigger. We first had a big one and then a smaller one and then a big one that—I think—was smaller than the first one.</p><p>I remember the image of the gummy vitamin that we bought from SNR. It felt quite revolutionary and mature to have gummy bear multivitamin for some reason.</p><p>I remember mostly empty Century Tuna cans that I often saw at our original church, at church outings, and at home. The cans would have bits of leftover at the bottom. It was rare to find one that was really cleaned to be empty.</p><p>I remember the large fern leaves and heavy sticks that we got throughout the original church years and maybe even during hikes or outings.</p><p>I remember having so many pimples at one point. 2017 maybe. I need to check my Google Keeps for the pictures and the dates they were written.</p><p>I remember scratching my pimples by mistake and crying over it, saying something along the lines of &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get that I struggle too.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know if there were other reasons at the time that led to me crying. Most likely there were, or I must have hated the itchy rash my face had and my body (had) too sometimes.</p><p>I remember the feeling of the various wood and items lying around in deep Alabang in front of the Alabang church. I remember how the rain looked and sounded like while we stayed inside the church. I remember the people heading inside or sitting or standing outside next to the walls.</p><p>I remember the sounds of the microphone, singing, and dancing from afar at the court there when we had the DVBS (or was it some other multi-day outreach event, like the one where we wore green shirts).</p><p>I remember discovering \ \url{http://thisartworkdoesnotexist.com} and feeling that this was revolutionary that I sent myself emails containing the images and even used the images.</p><p>I remember liking Ibuki Mioda from Danganronpa that I used her a profile Pic on wattpad if I remember correctly.</p><p>I remember the first wattpad image that I created when I made What Do I Want. Unfortunately, I cannot find the image in Canva. It was blue, depicting a house at the bottom side of the image. I believe the title of the story was set above on the top side of the image.</p><p>I remember enjoying and watching through the anime and play through of Danganronpa 1 and 2. I watched CinammonToastKen&rsquo;s playthroughs of them</p><p>I remember a basketball slamming against my face several times.</p><p>I remember the feeling of showering in the rain when I was much younger.</p><p>I remember seeing two kids showering in the rain at the court of Agro Homes during the big typhoon or bagyo. I think it was during Yolanda. I remember they were running through the passageway from the court toward the street where my home 501D is on, albeit it was at a part of the street was quite far away.</p><p>I remember the feeling of the door of the original church. There was an era when we went in through the main double doors and an era when we went through the side doors.</p><p>I remember the loud sound of the double glass doors closing.</p><p>I remember lying down on the church pews a lot.</p><p>I remember going at the mostly untouched, deep, vegetation-filled side of the church and playing tag and hide and seek with classmates, church mates, and friends.</p><p>I remember quite recently as of writing talking to my mom about something. We went to the garage because she was doing something. And then I think she got some PACEs, which were textbooks or modules, making me mentally flinch and making me lose strength to hold the plastic container of mangoes I was holding. Most of the mangoes hit the ground, but my mother said it was fine and that it was probably because I just woke up.</p><p>I remember crying because I lost at a children&rsquo;s game at Sunday School at my original church. I don&rsquo;t know why I cried, but I assume that I was scared of disappointing others. I was probably at that&rsquo;s age. Jhaidlyn Frias, James &ldquo;Badjoy&rdquo; Frias&rsquo; younger sister rather than older sister, was there and looked like she wanted to try to comfort me. (I thought her name was spelled &ldquo;Jhaudlyn.&rdquo; )</p><p>I remember writing down so many notes and \ thoughts throughout my life on paper and notebooks. I wish I could get those notes back. I would often write my daily devotions, take notes of sermons, and sometimes write down my pure thoughts on paper. I was not good at writing down with good grammar, with fiction writing experience that utilizes setting description, ect., and good sentence structure. However, it would still be good data, but yes, I prefer the present me rather than the past me. My ability to communicate my reality has improved drastically. Hopefully, I can improve more in describing places, which is why I study. Learning medical textbooks will help me understand my health and the health of those around me. (Not necessarily knowing. I need diagnostic tests for that.) Architecture and using apps like Autocad to document buildings and places well. Maps, ect. Studying in general and applying it in writing will help me document better. Learning skills like art, clay sculpting, dancing, and singing, among others, are all good ways to express and document the dynamic complexities of the inner world. Though, improving my skill in them will directly affect my ability to express. More control and intentionally means more accurate documentation. However, struggle or being bad at something but trying to improve is its own expression.</p><p>I remember carrying water containers and plastic bags a lot while walking, traveling, and at home.</p><p>I remember playing Minecraft and just making this huge, hollow pyramid.</p><p>I looked at an old Minecraft save file and learned that at one point, I played lots of hardcore Minecraft and enjoyed myself. I can count two periods of my recent line: one where I was listening to NF and made the pyramid and another where I was playing hardcore while, right before, or right after making the Viewer SMP Minecraft Server.</p><p>I remember when I began going to coffee bean. The few times I went to Starbucks before I began regularly going there were magical, as if entering a fantasy world with all the wonderful smells. I felt entranced by the colors, the tables, and the modern, minimal feel of it all. It was like entering a website with all the minimalist expressions while retaining the complexities that its products possess.</p><p>I remember a short moment in my life when I and my two younger brothers would go to National Book Store and the Book sale place. I remember the feeling of looking through books and the person at the counter whom my mother often knew—there were many people who were there, and I believe my mother knew them most of them, if not all. I remember reading a variety of books. I remember buying this one book: the squirrel fantasy book—The Mistmantle\ Chronicles: Urchin of the Riding Stars. I remember buying the elves and the shoemaker picture book. It was retold many times, and the specific shoemaker picture book I was looking for was not in Google Search. I found this story very satisfying.</p><p>I rub my right butt cheek from time to time whenever I urinate. I do it when I feel alone and, presumbably, because it has stretch marks. I also tend to put one finger inside my shorts and moved the rear end of the shorts further back. It&rsquo;s probably a habit I formed due to when I used to have loose shorts, to the numbness, to temperature change, or a combination of these.</p><p>I remember the feeling of seeing Cowhead, the milk brand, for the first time in a refrigerator. It was in Jeremiah&rsquo;s older house in the affluent neighborhood Alabang Hills, and I attributed it to luxury and riches.</p><p>I remember the sounds of the sky beating down on me—in reality, it was the sound of the national anthem. This was during I and my family&rsquo;s visit to the national museum where we live in the Philippines. I&rsquo;ve gone to the national meseum two times already I believe. I think several museums exist, so I might be wrong about which museum. Maybe there&rsquo;s an art museum and a history museum.</p><p>I was watching this video—just now as of writing—by the Youtuber Hungry Buttons of Michigan Metalfest and thought that the concert looked so polite that even the trees looked polite.</p><p>I remember standing still in a hallway after climbing up a long, wide spiral staircase. The ground was white, and the windows to the side leading to the outside were regular and rectangular with a rounded top. I remember my eldest half-brother Kuya Paulo standing a few meters away wearing a white t-shirt and black pants. I remember him gesturing me to respect the anthem with a stern expression.</p><p>Kuya Paulo, a long time ago, even said that he would kill someone if they even dared think of dismissing their own country. It was toward me and probably Timothy, Peter, or David when were in a popular Minecraft server like &ldquo;Hypixel&rdquo; or, more likely, &ldquo;Mineplex&rdquo;, and did or said something that conveyed dismissal of the Philippines, our country.</p><p>I remember the feeling of making the minecraft world save &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s My Bunny 1.9&rdquo;. I remember the deep, immersive feeling of diving into a world to create a map. It&rsquo;s still incompleted.</p><p>I remember making the parkour map that&rsquo;s still incomplete as of writing.</p><p>I remember the Youtube channel SamyUi that I made 10+ videos on but got deleted in 2019 or so. I don&rsquo;t remember deleting it.</p><p>I remember being made a leader in a team-building game in the youth service in New Life Alabang Church, but I was still very shy so I didn&rsquo;t really do anything. I was wearing a red shirt I believe at the time.</p><p>I remember jogging in MCA with the rest of the boys, following Coach Peter. I remember the feeling of running and the nostalgic feeling I felt since I&rsquo;ve been there so many times before. It was the place you get to if you go straight in Katarungan past MCA. (I think it was called Daang Hari.)</p><p>I remember when we went to there again but deeper in a forested area to do something for National Student Convetion. Ashley was there. That dude JM was there, not JM my closest friend from NCA. There&rsquo;s a JM from MCA and a JM from NCA.</p><p>I remember seeing Glenn biking, the dude with glasses who looked like John Joshua, who is someone I know well from NCA. Glenn often biked to school.</p><p>I remember when entraining or traveling via train to various places. I remember the feeling of heading to the station and just waiting, seeing the variety of different formats the station took on to handle prospective passengers who had tickets over many years.</p><p>I remember that we had The Baby-Sitters Club.</p><p>I remember when we had the fire mini-seminer–drill at MCA.</p><p>I remember Ninja Saga and Farmville.</p><p>I remember the samurai-ninja girl graphic novel and the bionicle graphic novel.</p><p>I remember having the encyclopedia for the Legends of Chima and watching Ninjago. I remember not even watching Legends of Chima. I remember watching Ninjago on some website that was difficult to watch in, probably because of ads. I stopped watching because it was too difficult on the website.</p><p>I think we had the DVD of the Adventures of Clutch Powers.</p><p>I remember trying to put the CD of a Dora the Explorer DVD, which we had in a yellow container, into my family&rsquo;s CD player and feeling disappointed that it didn&rsquo;t work. I remember trying to clean it with the CD cleaner we had, which I don&rsquo;t think ever really worked. We tried many times to use it though.</p><p>Just this morning as of writing at 7/9/2023 before 7:25 AM, I had a dream about pretending to be this crawling human creature.</p><p>I&rsquo;m on a spaceship. I&rsquo;m pretending to be a creature whose muscles is incapable of walking. I saw Apple, who is a person from the church networks, that I called hot.</p><p>I remember my mother pretending to be dead and then getting me to pretend being dead with her. That&rsquo;s when the spaceship monster-orc-aliens came and found us.</p><p>I decided to pretend I was just waking up from exhaustion or weakness, groaning, ect.</p><p>They brought me, and I remember there were girls there who I likened to dogs looking for a mate and thought to be unintelligent. I remember trying to look outside to see what was going on.</p><p>I remember one other guy besides the alien that found me trying to kill me. I think he looked like Aatrox. He kicked me once and then tried to put all his power into his next attack, almost killing me. However, I harmed him by either scratching or biting him—I imagined I was a creature so maybe I really did become a creature for that short moment. I remember one of the girls there asking me why I was on my phone, and I remember saying, &ldquo;Words are sugar.&rdquo; The woman accepted the answer, smiled, said &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; and left.</p><p>I remember there was something before my mother and I playing dead.</p><p>When Apple suddenly appeared, I spoke quickly and secretly, getting her to come closer. That&rsquo;s when I told her she was hot. I didn&rsquo;t see a discernable expression. I was waiting for her answer, saying, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>I remember Aidan.</p><p>I remember walking and passing through a long line of people, whom I believed to be my classmates from MCA. I remember that the line was set in a place full of hills and hilly, sloping, stepped roads</p><p>I remember that one of the roads connected to large gray bridges that resembled skyways. I remember floating downward from this bridges or skyways one by one. The bridges were high atop one another. I was floating down through low gravity that can only be experienced at the bridges. Hanging off the edge and then letting go was how I got down.</p><p>Aidan and a few others told me to be careful.</p><p>I remember almost falling at the last bridge, but I found a way to escape through a line or something that led to the ground. I remember seeing Aidan there. I think he was in a small rectangular pool on the ground.</p><p>After that, I forgot, but that somehow led to my mother and I playing dead.</p><p>I remember that there was something before the line of my classmates. I remember something before, but all I remember is weaving through the lines thrice. The place was like a labyrinth with the line being on a path that sloped downward and sharply turned as if in a staircase at one point.</p><p>I remember that in the dream, Aidan—and probably my classmates too—somehow knew about hanging down the bridge-skyway-expressway and using the low-gravity at the bridge-skyway-expressways to fall.</p><p>In reality, I remember the various impressions I had of MCA and my classmates. I remember getting funny looks and statements from Aidan, Andrei, and Robyn because I prayed every time before I ate. I remember the trio Aidan, Andrei, And Robyn joking all the time about sexual stuff and even made a joke about having intercourse with the staff—not the teachers specifically—of the school I believe. I remember even Paul, the person who kind of bullied me because he mistook my friendly smile as mockery and because I &ldquo;stole&rdquo; his president position, joking with the trio about forcibly having intercourse with Lyka because she was the only girl in one of the lower-floor classrooms.</p><p>I remember the smell of that specific lower-floor classroom.</p><p>I remember when we ate at the cafeteria instead of the new one that was beside the basketball court.</p><p>I remember seeing this girl from time to time give me a curious look. She was the one that looked like Kelsey. I think she was curious about what I would do in front of her since I was a new student especially and was in a different classroom as her.</p><p>I remember hearing her curse while she was getting in a UV as I was going home and getting this ominous feeling. At the time, I refrained from cursing at all times, but now, as of writing, I swear a lot sometimes with gusto sometimes casually with a lack of anger.</p><p>I remember the various events where people dressed and danced at MCA. I remember the darkness of the rest of the school to make way for the lighting of the stage.</p><p>I wished I could get a live 24/7 drone shot of the places I&rsquo;ve been to. I wish I could get the exact blueprints—revised constantly to portray accurately the changing state—of the places.</p><p>I remember getting into the tiny little shack next to the entrance of MCA of the guard there along with Aidan, Andrei, and Robyn. I remember having many talks with this guard at the assembly area where we had our roll calls every morning. This area is different from the church service area where I sang on stage.</p><p>I enjoyed the roll calls. That were the most fun or interesting times of my life there at MCA. I enjoyed doing the national anthem along with everyone. It gave a sense of community and cohesiveness. I enjoyed that same feeling at the church network.</p><p>I remember Enzo, who played the guitar very well. He looked like this depressed creature with his eyebags and messy hair. He and his older brother were definitely anomalies, which the various students of MCA subdivided. The older was so tall, and the younger brother looked depressed but had skills in rare areas like electric guitar, which in the Philippines was like having enough money to buy an electric guitar and equipment and play that in a home. Most people&rsquo;s homes were in a dense neighborhood, which meant that this person had much more advantage than most to be able to learn guitar so much.</p><p>Enzo would talk to me, and I thought he was a fun guy who reminded me of my cousin Jeremiah at times.</p><p>I remember the various warnings we were given at the roll calls. I remember hearing them say that fidget spinners gave people ADHD. I was in disblief in my mind because I believed that was 99% likely false.</p><p>I remember the &ldquo;Mr. Men and Little Miss&rdquo; series of picture books we had. Currently, I have one that has &ldquo;Mr. Bump&rdquo; in it, and it says &ldquo;Booksale,&rdquo; a place that sells books, and a date that reads, &ldquo;31 08 07 13&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m guessing the &ldquo;13&rdquo; means 2013.</p><p>List of &ldquo;Mr. Men and Little Miss&rdquo; picture books we had:
Mr. Bump,
Little Miss Naughty,
Mr. Christmas,
Mr. Skinny,
Mr. Rude,
Mr. Busy,
Mr. Nobody,
Little Miss Tiny,
Mr. Birthday,
Little Miss Twins,
Little Miss Birthday,
Little Miss Naughty and the Good Fairy,
Mr. Jelly,
Little Miss Sunshine and the Wicked Witch,
Mr. Clumsy,
Little Miss Somersault,
Little Miss Shy,
Mr. Grumpy,
Mr. Greedy,
Mr. Nonsense,
Mr. Impossible,
Mr. Men: A Christmas Carol,
Mr. Tickle,
I&rsquo;m pretty sure we had Mr. Happy too.</p><p>regarding MCA:</p><p>Part of me wished I could go back and kill everyone. Not out of anger or strife, but because I wish I could know them better. I wish I was crazy enough to go out of my way to get to know them, and the only kind of person who would break out of the pattern of shyness and societal mind-your-business attitude is a serial killer or mass murderer. I don&rsquo;t want to kill, but I wish I could break out of this pattern of fear. I want to ask them everything and truly understand them with the confidence of someone who&rsquo;s crazy because it would need someone crazy to want to begin to understand others with all the pain and the heartache.</p><p>I feel so much guilt and pain regarding my younger brothers, but I need to get things done instead of feeling all this emotions and expressing them without being productive. I wish I was God, so I can understand others. I don&rsquo;t want to rely on preconceptions. I want to keep studying and talking to others to understand them, but of course, I still need to be sane by the end of it.</p><p>I remember the feeling of dancing and the advice of one of the teachers, whose name was Angelo. He was the one who thought I was lazy, but I was dealing with losing my large church community of many years, my family&rsquo;s near breakup, the pressures of being expected from, and various other issues relating to community and family.</p><p>I remember that the advice of Angelo was to make stiff movements while dancing because that was how good dancers danced.</p><p>I remember the advice of the mother of Shemi, one of the alumi of MCA. It was to raise the eyebrows while singing. She also taught me some scales. I remember her saying that I was different from others because my singing got better as I sustained a note rather than getting worse. I believe it was because I was shy. This was when I was getting teaching from her at her home with the piano. I remember getting recorded with a microphone.</p><p>I remember talking to Clara. She had this facial expression while talking to me that I had registered time and time again as faint infatuation. I didn&rsquo;t like her in the end even after Lauren rejected me. Maybe for a brief moment but it was out of fear of abandonment due to the turbulent state of my life at the time. Once she ignored me, which I&rsquo;m happy she did, I set on to continue to deal with my issues.</p><p>I remember the person who blocked me on Facebook. When we were in MCA, she was so nice, but I never liked her romantically. I wanted to be friends with her after I quit school, but she might&rsquo;ve thought I was being too weird in DMs. I wished I could be friends. At one point, I realized I wasn&rsquo;t sexually or romantically attracted, but I just needed friends. I needed friends from people who provided a different perspective to my life—women. I was hoping they could change the way I saw my life. Maybe they were different. Maybe I could learn something from them and learn how to become better. However, I received none of that. Her name was something something and then her last name was Carlit or something. (I remembered a few hours later. It&rsquo;s Jade Carlit.) Her brother reminded me of Peter, which made it easier for me to talk to him from time to time during my time at MCA. Even now, he reminds me of Peter when Peter was at a certain stage of his life.</p><p>I remember Katrina Kagandahan, with whom I had fun. Several classmates did the thing where they tried to couple us as a joke, but I really liked girls because they made it easier for me to understand the world. I had a more kinder perspective of the world due to the way I was raised. The women in my life provided that, which made me believe that women outside of my life provided that kind of kinder perspective. I learned that men around my age talked about things I didn&rsquo;t understand. I understood League of Legends, but I didn&rsquo;t understand the constant sexual talk and the sports and the shoes. I grew up more in church and among millennial adults rather than among kids my age. And if it was kids, it was always during church outreaches where they were much more disadvantaged.</p><p>I remember how bad I was at talking. Even recently, I talked in such a relatively formal way on Discord Dms.</p><p>I remember talking to Lauren and asking her if she was fine with appearing in my webcomic. Not her face or her full name. Just her first name—Lauren. I liked her and had a crush on her. It all started when she wore the glasses of one of Juan Antonio Gutierrez. I forgot Juan&rsquo;s nickname.</p><p>I remember the nice women of MCA—Kathleen Lam, Angelika, and that other girl that looked Chinese and was a little chubby, among other women.</p><p>I remember thinking so many times that Angelika liked me but then decided she was just nice again and again.</p><p>I remember Mon Jenray Grava and the heavy, slow way he walked.</p><h2 id=churches-and-events>Churches and Events
<a class=anchor href=#churches-and-events>#</a></h2><p>\include{churchesAndEvents}</p><p>I remember Tita Nhora&rsquo;s discipline while trying to make us do the dancing–performance–spoken poetry thing. I learned a day later from when I wrote the last sentence that it was a speech choir.</p><p>I remember feeling like crying at one point, but I think I could see the concern in Tita Nhora&rsquo;s face.</p><p>I remember someone, probably Kuya Mark, asking me if I was okay after the practice and rehearsal.</p><p>I thought while listening to a song with a monologue: &ldquo;Stop crying. I don&rsquo;t want to hear another person cry anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You shall see me, and I shall see you. I shall eat you, and you shall eat me.&rdquo;</p><p>I thought this in reference to me looking through my many old pictures and remembering how I look like and who I was. I meant that for the present me and myself—the becoming one whole.</p><p>People that I&rsquo;ve Met:

Chloe Raine Cuna,</p><p>probably:
Lorence Adamos,</p><p>I remember sharing the dreams of the moon shifting from white to red in the day of tribulation to my mother, who, of course, took it seriously. Though, she took my dream about using an Ipad where I created 3D models of engineering stuff more seriously to the point of mentioning a few times.</p><p>I remember eating frooty loops and corn flakes at Jeremiah&rsquo;s house. I remember the Shakey&rsquo;s Pizza with cheese in the crust that we ate at their living room. I remember the &ldquo;hot&rdquo; spicy sauce and the warning not to eat in the room and only to eat in the dinner area of the house.</p><p>I remember the spiral stairs on the side of a church building at the place where Ate Priscilla and her husband got married. I remember the face of the Pastor who was rumored to have cheated through a church member. This was before 2019 I believe.</p><p>I remember the feeling of walking home outside of the building and outside of the premises of Mike&rsquo;s second wedding. I remember Ate Rica nearby and her elaborate dress.</p><p>I remember the registration and how familiar I was with the various things there.</p><p>I remember the feeling of sitting down at the Starbucks reserve. I remember one time when I was reading a textbook about sound engineering on the Ipad.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know if this milestone of actually being able to continue to write an autobiography means that I&rsquo;m so much more intelligent than before, and part of me believes that I have transcended past that ignorant, inside-the-box way of looking at my overall life.</p><p>I remember the awkward feeling of playing console games at the house of Tito Nikki, my cousin Luis&rsquo; father from my Dad&rsquo;s side. While Tito Nikki was standing behind us at the door and squatting in the room with us, he had this very strange, almost haughty expression, but maybe that was my misunderstanding.</p><p>I remember playing with the bouncy ball in their home and the cumbersome, loud staircase.</p><p>I remember the feeling of sitting down and eating and the strange, watchful expressions of Tita Steph, the wife of Tito Nikki, the mother of Luis.</p><p>I remember the feeling of walking down the road to the swimming pool and back to their house. It felt long, and I remember seeing a statue or reindeer or something.</p><p>I remember feeling that the light was so oppressive, falling directly when heading to Tito Nikki&rsquo;s house.</p><p>I remember the various items such as bikes in their small garage.</p><p>I remember Tito Nikki or my Dad surveying these items.</p><p>I remember doing a back flip at that old camp. I have the pictures, but I forgot where. JM was with me at the time. I hit my back and hurt myself a little. I was stunned for a while and had to sit down and wait out the &ldquo;ugh&rdquo; feeling.</p><p>I remember going to the pool at GB and Arron&rsquo;s house so many times.</p><p>I remember feeling happy every time I see Arron go to church service or some youth event.</p><p>I remember feeling weirded out by Arron not closing his eyes during group prayer because I believe I either learned or was taught not to close my eyes during prayer. Maybe I learned or was taught when I was at kindergarten or something years before my confusion with Arron.</p><p>I remember the feeling of going to school with my brothers and lining up with different people like Raven, Clarence, and probably JM. Each line was a different grade, and we were lining up for roll call in the morning to sing the national anthem. I remember some students were tasked to do the flag raising or something. Other tasks that I believe existed included cleaning trash, among others.</p><p>I remember Kelsey&rsquo;s younger sister distinctly because she carried an especially pink lunchbox bag or something. The rest carried lunch bags that looked black, crocodile green, brown, or red.</p><p>I remember the red and black lunchbox of Jeremiah because he left it at his personal desk for a long time until webs started to form. I forgot why Jeremiah left. The lunchbox depicted the main protagonist of the American computer animation studio &ldquo;Pixar&rdquo; movie &ldquo;Cars&rdquo; with its red color.</p><p>I remember the neutral interaction between my cousin Jeremiah and my friend Ram because they were from different worlds.</p><p>I assume that this distinct neutrality intrigued me because I was used to friendly relations and I had a curious impression of both Jeremiah and Ram, seeing them as two individuals with relatively strange personalities, mannerisms, and backgrounds.</p><p>I remember the oppressive feeling of the trees and the surrounding bushes when we arrived at the jungle where we got coconut straight from the trees with the help of our hiking tour guide when we went hiking at a mountain.</p><p>When we were about to hike and when we were about to leave the entrance to the mountain, I remember the lonesome screaming of the empty road, crying out to me and tearing inside me a distinct flash of memory. I saw across the street a wide road leading upward. I saw a building at the junction and the familiar wooden shapes which formed its parts. I had emotions, and I had consciousness.</p><p>I remember the feeling of wearing that red shirt that read &ldquo;Zone 2&rdquo; and the feeling of waking up in the early morning and seeing that shirt. That distinct flash of memories again.</p><p>I remember the feeling of eating champorado many, many times. I remember the lugaw we ate many times especially the time we ate at a lugaw restaurant in a crowded area in Makati, or was it Mandaluyong. I remember eating lugaw at our original church in manifold ways and times. I remember the feeling of eating lugaw at the Vacation Bible School when we wore mint-colored shirts with the concomitant graphic.</p><p>I remember the feeling of staring at the few people across the street as I walked from the gym.</p><p>I remember the euphoria and fear that I felt as I walked home from the gym one time. I thought that I could die anytime. Often, maybe not at that time, when I had an sudden, intrusive thought that if I died, I had another sudden intrusive thought that it would have been alright because I felt so satisfied.</p><p>I remember having a dream with Kuya Ryan who used to be from my original church with it. I feel like I wrote this dream down somewhere. I remembered it out of the blue for some reason while I was putting old food in the trash. Maybe the list of factors combined to form the faint feeling that led to me remembering this dream: old banana, plates with old food, old milk, and old</p><p>I remember reading the art book of the artist of How&rsquo;s Moving Castle there at Powerbooks.</p><p>I remember when I had the dream about Kuya Ryan that it was in the court. This dream was from a long time ago, and I only remembered it all of a sudden. It was a faint feeling and blurry image though.</p><p>I notice very specific memories get triggered in seemingly random moments via a coordinated combination of factors.</p><p>I believe that even the angle and position of objects relative to me can trigger memories. What the specific objects are and their various angles and relative positions within the objects contained within their structure matters as well.</p><p>I remember a dream where it was like a Y8 game in the long past. I remember a brown train-looking structure through one image that appears in my mind. Orangey kind of pallete with windows that looked more gray than blue.</p><p>I remember a dream where I was playing Kled at top lane.</p><p>I had many dreams depicting League of Legends .</p><p>I remember crying while looking at the texture of the white wall in my room.</p><p>I had a dream.</p><p>I remember the egg monsters who fought and trained. They are. I remember a woman that I said they were going to be sparring or training with.</p><p>I remember that the woman some kind of monster as well.</p><p>I remember that Earwin was on our side. I remember that he was from Earth and that he was trying to find a way to die. Someone was preventing him.</p><p>I remember that when he finally was able to shoot himself, he was smiling so widely with his eyes very big two-dimensionally like in anime.</p><p>I remember the person who was with him making sure he couldn&rsquo;t kill himself.</p><p>I was with them. I remember that after Earwin (From Attack on Titan) killed himself. I killed myself too by shooting myself. I remember lying there against a wall looking at a empty floor that looked like the outside due to how wide it was. I remember that it was inside though.</p><p>I remember we entered through a door.</p><p>I remember that I was riding a bike and retreating from a group of people on bikes.</p><p>I remember that the bikes had new technology that it faster (or better).</p><p>I remember running through these tunnels.</p><p>The room where Earwin died was somewhere.</p><p>There was a path leading sideways that diverged from the very wide tunnel.</p><p>I remember seeing the forms of the bikers from afar in the tunnel.</p><p>I remember that since Earwin came from Earth, when he killed himself, he came back to Earth or something.</p><p>However, I didn&rsquo;t, so when I killed myself, I just died.</p><p>I remember the frustrated look of the person who was supposed to be preventing Earwin from killing himself.</p><p>I remember that person holding the World War 2 German pistol and finishing me off.</p><p>The monster eggs and the woman who was probably a monster could have been in a scene before Earwin or after. Though, I&rsquo;m sure it was before. It just seemed like that because I remembered the eggs first as soon as I awoke. I remember the feeling that the eggs were gone, but at the same time, maybe they had something to do with Earwin and were on Earwin&rsquo;s and my side.</p><p>I remember that Earwin shot himself while hiding behind a thin, rectangular wall that acted as a pillar while the person preventing him from killing himself was on the other side. I forgot what this person was doing or what we were doing in the room. Maybe I wasn&rsquo;t even with Earwin and only came after a while because I was still running from the bikers while on a bike earlier.</p><p>I remember that when Earwin entered the room, it was through double doors. Maybe the doors were open already.</p><p>In hindsight, the person who prevented Earwin from killing himself could have been or looked like the character Levi from Attack on Titan. (Maybe.)</p><p>In real life, I remember going to central park where a certain band &ldquo;Going to the Zoo&rdquo; or something was playing at a stage. I remember the numerous crowds and the various stalls. My sister Danielle and various other youths with her and adults had stalls and sold stuff there regularly.</p><p>I remember Badjoy coming there, and I remember Timothy and Iana.</p><p>I remember reading an erotica book at Lola Cecille&rsquo;s house. I remember the yard they had and the various items and smells on that yard. I remember the strands of grass and the smell of the wind, heat, and rain.</p><p>I remember the sound of the rain while I was downstairs in the basement-like bedroom of Lola Cecille. This room had a window that led to the yard. The yard was in an enclosed area within the already enclosed grounds of Lola Cecille&rsquo;s home. I remember the canals at the farthest side of the yard from the viewpoint of the window. It used to be open that you could fall in, but I think it&rsquo;s closed or blocked with wood or metal or something.</p><p>I remember that I was outside near Agro Homes Subd. at our homecity Muntinlupa City probably at a computer shop or heading to a computer shop. Or maybe I was at the basketball court of Agro Homes or walking the streets. I remember hearing that my friend Ram&rsquo;s mother used urine as a way to help with sunburns or something or maybe as a way to clean better.</p><p>I remember the girl Chloe or maybe Clowey. It was pronounced Clowey, but I never got to know the spelling. She used to live farther up Ram&rsquo;s street at Agro Homes Subd., the same street my home 501D was in but Ram&rsquo;s house was much, much deeper or farther inside Agro Homes. I remember Chloe&rsquo;s face and the friends she had. I remember throwing a crumpled paper at one of her friends and making them cry as a result. I remember entering Chloe&rsquo;s house and taking a picture with her on Facebook as we sat down on a couch. I think I remember her parent or her maid nearby. I don&rsquo;t remember why or how I got to know her. Maybe I was biking and saw them. Maybe I was at the park and saw them. Maybe I was at the basketball court and saw them.</p><p>I think my mother gaslighted me into believing that she didn&rsquo;t swear, which is one of the moments that I still remember and affect my ability to believe her when she talks about the rumor that Pastor Sierra from our original church tried to exploit her sexually. She also lied that David was our full-blooded brother; in reality, David was only half-blooded. She also lied about cheating on my Dad a year or a few years before the situation with Pastor Sierra.</p><p>I remember when I was at the Baguio camp or conference where I stayed for a few days. I remember going to a hospital and praying for those sick. I was with a group of people because we were assigned to groups.</p><p>I remember passing various alleyways in Baguio with my mother.</p><p>I remember going through a crowd in a night market in Baguio along with Ate Priscilla and that one dude with glasses that I forgot—I think his name started with an E. Eman or something. We were attending the Youth Prophetic conference with Brother Sadhu I believe. I remember crying as soon as &ldquo;the spirit touched me&rdquo; when Brother Sadhu pressed my forehead. I burst into tears and just lay there as if I was in a state of euphoria and a state where I experienced omnipresent and omniscient like the world was surrounding me. I remember seeing the various faces and some who didn&rsquo;t end up crying. I remember thinking their hearts were hard.</p><p>I remember wanting to buy the Shadow of Mordor game and asking my Dad if we could buy it. My Dad declined. At that time, we were struggling with money a lot more than now as of writing. I&rsquo;m glad that we didn&rsquo;t buy that game because my inclinations and tendencies have changed drastially manifold times since then.</p><p>We experienced relative social mobility over the years and that allowed me to learn, understand, and communicate the words I&rsquo;m saying now.</p><p>I remember the feeling of running through the streets of Agro Homes and the feeling of the wind. I remember the tingling sensation in my skin from the increased blood flow and elevated heart rate during cardio exercise.</p><p>I remember playing the game where we pressed the doorbell and ran. I think we did that a couple of times throughout the years. Not much.</p><p>I remember selling graham balls to the mother of Jerry and Jerome De Mesa.</p><p>I remember the satisfying feeling of selling graham balls at MCA. I remember that I gave away free graham balls on someone&rsquo;s birthday. I remember that I was very hard when it came to preventing people from doing &ldquo;utang&rdquo; or loaning. They usually waited until I forgot. When I did do utang, I made sure to pester them until they gave me the money. They did the utang thing to David and got away with it.</p><p>Remembering that people just do that irritates me.</p><p>I remember the various faces at MCA and the complex minds that inhabit them. I remember the various environments and the various items around.</p><p>I remember the various items in boxes at the McDo Kiddie Crew Workshop. I think it was shoes and various clothes.</p><p>I remember the same ordered boxes at the bowling place where we got different shoes and such because we needed special shoes for the certain floor.</p><p>I remember the gate that led to the yard at MCA after you went downstairs from the lobby or assembly area. The gate was white and it was wide, shaped like a rectangular with a circular top.</p><p>I remember the bright light that shone past the gate.</p><p>I remember the basketball court and the window high above it that led to the church service area.</p><p>I remember the various Bible things for projects or exam or something while we stayed at the church service area.</p><p>I remember walking home alongsideCiaraand Rovi Evangelista. I remember walking home alongside Sophia. I remember walking home alongside Icah.</p><p>I remember seeing Lauren get into a white bit truck car (SUV) and thinking that she was indeed wealthy even if she denied such claims.</p><p>I remember waking up and going to Mcdonalds, feeling like I was stuck in a dream because I was still unfamiliar with waking up like this. I was in Jeremiah&rsquo;s old house, and I was woken up by Tita Maris. I have a strange feeling when it comes to Jeremiah&rsquo;s old house because I remember the older bed. I remember how it felt and the size of the room and bed. I remember sleeping on the floor I think.</p><p>I remember going to Mcdonalds and feeling luxurious and in that dream state while I was in the car.</p><p>I forgot whether I had problems with anyone at that time.</p><p>I remember a cousin who happens to be gay kissed Jeremiah or something, and it ended horribly because of course, it was a Christian family. Jeremiah had insecurities concerning homosexuality because I remember that someone hacked his account and called him gay there as well either before or after this event with the cousin. I think that the hacked account was one of the reasons he left my old school NCA. I&rsquo;m starting to remember that it was probably because we went to the computer shop and that he left his account logged in there.</p><p>I remember that cousin who kissed Jeremiah staying in my home. I remember sleeping on the double deck while this cousin slept on the floor. I remember the faint light that kept the room dimly lit.</p><p>I forgot why that cousin was in our house, but I remember that he was also with another cousin, maybe two or three more. I remember that these cousins, I, and my family were going somewhere and these cousins were only staying for one night.</p><p>I made up the term &ldquo;with an A plus&rdquo; as a way to say emphasize similar to the word &ldquo;really.&rdquo; This could be attributed to the fact that &ldquo;A+&rdquo; normally means a &ldquo;really&rdquo; good grade in school.</p><p>Example: &ldquo;How about no with an A plus?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; with emphasis.</p><p>I remember that my second therapist somehow got to know that I like heavy metal. Most likely, I told him when he asked about music or maybe I just mentioned it randomly. I remember him writing down stuff on paper and asking him about what was written. He showed me the paper, and I forgot what I saw. I remember the room: the shelf with a picture frame of a flower and some books or something. I remember items for coloring, which I learned from my therapist that it was for kids. I forgot what the window looked like. I remember that the room was very small and also not as sound-proofed as I preferred at the time. I remember saying that I liked the claustro or trapped feeling of being in the room. I think I remember my therapist asking me that if I was uncomfortable, we could move to another room. I remember crying a lot. I remember taking a month or two or something before I ever bawled. I might&rsquo;ve cried here and there earlier, but it took a while for me to cry in that angry, frustrated way.</p><p>I remember the first therapist that I went to. She had this very apathetic demeanor. I remember that when we spent only five minutes, that&rsquo;s when I realized that she didn&rsquo;t give a shit. I, of course, stopped it at that point, and that&rsquo;s when I got to know my second therapist Dave soon after. I remember of feeling of being in that first therapist&rsquo;s room. The feeling of being in a doctor&rsquo;s office was stale and almost reminiscient of being inspected from my previous sessions with doctors. I remember being honest enough that I was vulnerable, but then, she reacted very calmly. I did not think much of it at the time, but as time passed, I had a growing suspicion that she lacked the proper emphatic senses to deal with me and my concerns. So, I left.</p><p>After looking at some old pictures, I remember the manifold toys that I and my male siblings had.</p><p>I remember various people whom my mother encountered on the street on the sidewalk and not knowing who they were but them knowing me.</p><p>After looking at a picture, I remember a certain wall in our previous apartment before 501D Canary St. It was me kissing my mom in the lips. That was the only time that I remember kissing my mom on the lips, which is why I still remember it. This wall had versus from what I can detect in the distance in the picture.</p><p>I remember that we had hamsters even at our old apartment. I remember how the babies looked like after looking at some pictures. We had four hamsters apparently based on the pictures. I remember seeing the hamsters run on the hamster wheel and remember the mother hamster eating babies. I remember how the hamsters looked like when they died. They looked silent and almost like they were sleeping.</p><p>The urge to organize and thus give a comprehensive model to understand and communicate myself.</p><p>Why do I have to let injustice continue just so that the current state of things is not disrupted? When the pastor from the denomination of churches sexually exploited my mother, the leaders along with the regional director of the denomination swept it under the rug.</p><p>The same way, I experienced invalidations from parents, teachers, and various leaders that I trusted alike. I was a model student who obeyed the rules and performed excellently, a model child, and a model sibling, yet when I struggled, people only treated me with apathy and callousness. Even now, I struggle and wonder if maybe I should continue to address the issues as formally and as orderly as possible when no one cares because no one believes me.</p><p>Is it correct to sweep things under the rug in order to maintain the homeostasis of the community and broader society?</p><p>My father has treated me unfairly and constantly imposed perfectionism that he believed as &ldquo;normal&rdquo; and &ldquo;something that should be done anyway.&rdquo; When I finally accomplished goals that he had gestured through his conversations, he treated it with a dismissing demeanor, which exacerbated my perfectionism.</p><p>I just want to follow the rules, but why does it feel like the rules are being broken by the leaders that have set them? It doesn&rsquo;t make sense for me to follow the rules, yet I continue to do so optimistically.</p><p>I remember the expression of another pastor from another church looking at me with worry only when I expressed personal fortitude and struggle while singing as a part of the praise and worship team. It was as if he only concerned himself with how the praise and worship team appeared to the broader community rather than the possible struggle of an individual member of the church. Of course, I&rsquo;m most likely misunderstanding, but I was at a vulnerable place, which made this encounter much more visceral and intense to me.</p><p>I was trying so hard to be a model example at everything that people thought it was just talent and genetics when in fact, I have evidence to prove that I used to be perform badly. I had a conviction to improve myself in order to battle the lack of integrity exhibited by the leaders of my life. Because people thought my excellence was just me being normal and not actually trying hard, they treated me with dismissal when I finally expressed struggle after maintaining composure for so long.</p><p>When I finally broke out of shyness and exhibited confidence that I had struggled to create, some treated me as if I was arrogant. When I smiled and laughed out of genuine optimism and camaraderie, some thought I was mocking them.</p><p>This is a sweeping statement, but often, I feel that somes people don&rsquo;t want to see me for who I am. I feel that they just expect perfection and ignore and dismiss me when I address my complex issues. I feel that they&rsquo;re constantly trying to justify themselves rather than wonder where they went wrong.</p><p>I feel that I am weak and hypocritical, but I am optimistic rather than cynical. This is the way that I keep going in a world full of complexities, especially people.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve improved myself so much and learned how to manage my emotions so much better throughout the previous manifold years.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also begun to document myself and write an autobiography in order to address my hypocrisy, issues, and celebrations throughout the years.</p><p>Now, I&rsquo;m being productive and managing my emotions through a multitude of activities such as learning violin, drawing, dancing, writing, singing, guitar, programming, Youtube creation, blogging, and documentation, among others.</p><p>I remember getting lost in SM Mall Alabang and after asking some guards, I felt like I was beginning to cry.</p><p>I remember that my mother went and forgot something I believe or something at a jeep and went there to get it, but most likely this is wrong. I think I was there because I went to National Bookstore to read or buy books or something.</p><p>I remember the various crushes I&rsquo;ve had over the years: Aya Rosales, Tanja De Guzman, Kelsey Eunice Turalde Besa, Meriel Vecino, Graciela Lauren Villena, Shena Marie Serrano, among others. Other crushes whom I liked for shorter times included Jaja Manalo, Clara (it was actually Ciara Mea Claros. I mispelled her name.), Venus Sungcang from MCA, Ardy Sierra, Caroline Ariglo, among others.</p><p>This could be the last time that I wrote, so I&rsquo;ll write my best.</p><p>I remember going to a NCA classmate&rsquo;s house for his birthday. He was Yuan, or something like that. It was pronounced like that I think. I assume now that he was probably autistic, and I feel bad that I thought he was weird and teased him about with it with JM. We were there at his b-day party probably because we were the only ones who talked to him. Maybe it was just a visit rather than a birthday. We watched and played God of War of his PSP. I remember thinking that the trash was placed in an unsanitary way. The room where Yuan lived was high and small. We had to climb a lot of steps to get to his home. I believe either the outside of the walls were green or the inside of the walls were green, but I could be wrong. It could have been someone else with him rather than JM, but I am sure that I went there. I remember the strange feeling of seeing God of War for the first time and seeing a PSP for the first time as well. The only console my family had was the Gameboy from our uncle on my Dad&rsquo;s side.</p><p>I remember the games we played on the Gameboy. I remember the Dora game, the Penguins Madagascar game, and probably some other games as well. The gameboy had these less popular games rather than Mario and Sonic.</p><p>I remember looking at Lauren&rsquo;s face when she went to my desk at MCA one time. I saw the way she looked down and the way her hair drooped. I usually saw her with a ponytail, but from time to time, she would let her hair droop. Honestly, I tried to make sense of it and understand why and how the frequency played into the assumptions that I made throughout. Of course, these assumptions were just out of curiosity and because I was infatuated. She was leaning against the wall of the desk, and that&rsquo;s what got my attention the most. That was one of the most one-on-one moments I had with her, if not the most, which was probably why I remember it.</p><p>I remember seeing the pineapple stalls as we travelled on a vehicle to or through Tagaytay and finding them interesting because they were hard to find where I lived, another place instead of Tagaytay.</p><p>I remember the feeling of staying at the rock seats at the park of Agro Homes Subd. and just being among people from my original church.</p><p>I remember the feeling of bringing Ardy to my birthday party and recognizing that she was the only girl there. I remember having a casual talk with someone, probably my mother, about it either before, during, or after the b-day party.</p><p>I remember the grin that EK Halili had on his face.</p><p>I remember that Ardy would often just resort to using her phone during gatherings with my original church.</p><p>I remember two banquets while I was attending MCA, one at Muntinlupa Sports Complex and one at Crimson Hotel.</p><p>I learned that Kuya Glenn paid for the unlimited rice at Superbowl in 2014 probably at or before May 1. (Source: Faye Ann Sierra&rsquo;s post from May 1, 2014 regarding Kuya Paulo&rsquo;s birthday.)</p><p>I remember Jerylie Purification. He was bullied and treated unfairly. He wasn&rsquo;t only teased, but he was mocked with maliciousness. I remember him crying. He was the kind of person who was bad at talking and spoke in boisterous Tagalog while the others who lived in middle class or upper middle class had a much more humurous and polite Tagalog.</p><p>I felt bad for him, but I didn&rsquo;t know how to handle the feelings of guys. I only believed that he was a good person in heart, but he didn&rsquo;t know how to get along with people from different social classes. So yes, in a way, he experienced classism.</p><p>I remember eating SPAM in my lunchbox at NCA while studying there.</p><p>I remember the Japanese girl that went to church.</p><p>I remember playing LAN Minecraft with JM at this one computer shop, probably the first computer shop I and my close friends went to.</p><p>I remember that I went to the gym for two months twice, once at 2022 or 2021 and again at 2023. I performed much better the second time, but I left due to interpersonal conflict with whoever was putting dumbbells onto my exercise machine while I was working out and focused.</p><p>I finally got a lot of my pictures from the past almost set.</p><p>I was thinking about Lola Cecile and Fernando Marasigan (with his motorcycle friend group), among others, when I posted the profile picture this July 2023, somewhat inspired or dedicated because of them.</p><p>I had a dream about Roblox.</p><p>I remember that I was playing roblox, but the way the dream was presented made it seem that I was inside the game because it showed the game only rather than real life.</p><p>I could even hear the people trying to kill me talking as if it was reality.</p><p>I was in a Roblox game where I had a sword. I forgot exactly what my clothes looked like, but I think I had a semi-elaborate attire with a hat.</p><p>I had a base where a group of young girls were attacking me. I believe that I had offended them.</p><p>I remember that in the dream, I came back to play Roblox after a long time. I drew ire from the girls for a reason that I forgot. I think they were mobbing me out of me doing something that they perceived as bad.</p><p>I remember that I was &ldquo;hiding&rdquo; on a square plot that was made up of smaller square plots with written text that regarded various ailments such as blindness. Actually, I forgot what they were exactly, but I remember having text along the lines of &ldquo;Disabled&rdquo; as in physically disabled following me around and representing me. I hid by positioning myself on the boxes and being part of the rest of the boxes with various texts.</p><p>I remember walking and them attacking me as soon as I left the square plot. I believe that since I was in Roblox, I could only walk. Running was a functionality you had to implement in Roblox Studio.</p><p>I remember using the sword to attack the Roblox characters that represented the girls. They wore an attire that looked quite elaborate in a manner that fitted an ornate, golden-clothed soldier of some sort rather than a typical attire for a young girl.</p><p>I remember that my base was a ramp that curved upward to a wall. The square plot as next to a wall as well. We were in a enclosed area.</p><p>I remember that the girls were talking somewhat casually while they waited for me to exit the square plot. When I did exit, they still talked somewhat casually for people who disliked me.</p><p>Their voices sounded faint rather than vehement with rage.</p><p>I remember thinking about League of Legends, maybe regarding lux, when I exited the plot and ran toward my base nearby. My base was a short distance away from the square plot.</p><p>The square plot was next to an eastern wall, while my ramp base was next to a northern wall.</p><p>I believe my base had the ability to lazer attack enemies that came inside. My base was only a ramp, but if the girls stayed inside, they would lose a great sum—probably half—of their health over seconds.</p><p>I remember I was fighting a stronger enemy that I needed to kill via the base lazer. I remember seeing a League of Legends health bar over this stronger enemy that may or may not have been one of the girls. Most likely, it was someone else.</p><p>I remember using the sword correctly by rotating from side to side to make the non-collidable touching part, the sword, collide several times faster and more by quickly making it escape touch only to again touch the body parts of my target, applying greater damage overall. Rotating from side to side allowed the sword to escape touch, and the touch event was when the damage was applied to the target.</p><p>I remember that there was more to the dream before the girls and the Roblox.</p><p>I believe my base had a white transparent, non-collidable wall that signified that it was a base and my base for one and that passing through this wall would make the lazer start attacking you.</p><p>I remember that the reason the square plot helped me escape from the girls temporarily was regarding their tendency to avoid attacking someone who was among the texts that displayed various illness like the text &ldquo;Disabled&rdquo; representing me only during my time at the square plot.</p><p>I remember in the dream feeling that I was wasting my time maybe because I was playing Roblox or League of Legends.</p><p>I forgot the weapons of the girls, but I remember them killing me several times.</p><p>I remember seeing the typical blue sky above the enclosed area once I went to the base and began to use the sword attacking technique on one of the girls.</p><p>I remember a distinct feeling and thought process that I had within the dream. I believe that I was thinking about real life outside of the Roblox game but still within the dream and the things happening like the girls and beginning to become introspective within the dream.</p><p>I had a half-asleep dream where I was somewhat half-playing and half-inside a book/film/game. The medium, called Office Saga, introduced various environments such as watery office hallway, computer with lots of cable networks mixed with vegetation and greeny. I heard and/or read comments while inside the medium that the way that the computers mixed together was unique.</p><p>I remember the lizard that was brought into the medium that had a poisonous tail I believe. I believe I somehow brought it in or created it via some game developer kind of way.</p><p>I remember one of the comments reading something about the ending and why it was so something.</p><p>I remember the Amazon-like page where I saw the medium.</p><p>I remember that the lizard went inside a water tank and then later left, ending the dream with me unable to retreat despite wanting to.</p><p>The water tank was one of many on a wall.</p><p>I had the impression that there were other people in the images I remembered regarding the dream.</p><p>I remember that I had the impression that the medium also had the word &ldquo;Ocean&rdquo; something in the title or name.</p><p>I remember having a lot of scattered thoughts that contradicted the theme of the dream throughout.</p><p>I forgot if there was a scene before the Office Saga part of the dream.</p><p>I remember looking at the vegetated computers through a door either from a video or picture or being there. The computers looked white and retro sci-fi in a minimalistic design kind of way but simultaneously in a teeming manner due to the size and connectedness of the computers onto one another. It was like seeing a pile of computers formed together into a breathing machine due to the visual cohesiveness.</p><p>The watery office hallways were flooded either up to the top of the waist around the upper abdomen or up to the top of the pecs.</p><p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure I remember that someone, maybe one of the commenters, has wanted to ask me about the lizard, but I have the impression that I&rsquo;ve sought to avoid these.</p><p>I had a dream.</p><p>I remember being in a room where a korean-looking older girl was at an office-looking desk. I remember the fact that that part was about singers or &ldquo;artistas.&rdquo; The older woman&rsquo;s daughter was a singer too. Before this older woman, her daughter was the one sitting at the counter I think. I remember a guy who was the boyfriend of the daughter I think, or maybe another female artista.</p><p>I remember the older woman and somehow knowing around her daughter&rsquo;s age how she looked like when she was younger. I even got a comparison &ldquo;after and before&rdquo; image.</p><p>I remember that the guy being happy about exercising and being healthy. I remember hearing about markers of health, and I remember that if it wasn&rsquo;t for the daughter, he wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten healthy somehow.</p><p>I had a dream.</p><p>I remember that I was sleepy and that I was supposed to go somewhere to do &ldquo;tropical drums.&rdquo; I remember that my mother was telling me that I could go. I was here at home at the garage, and it was night. For some reason, a group of about three people whom I didn&rsquo;t know were sitting down in the garage. They were probably brought there by my mother.</p><p>I remember that me playing tropical drums was supposed to be at a plaza or something probably with Ate Danielle and Kuya Glenn.</p><p>I remember I was talking with somebody before I was asked to play tropical drums. I remember that this somebody was strange.</p><p>I remember that I was getting very sleepy, which made it difficult for me to go play drums. I wanted to be alone enough that I can masturbate, not that I would masturbate. However, being very alone made it easier to sleep.</p><p>I remember talking to my Dad and hearing from him that tropical drums is very easy because you just do simple beats with the drum in regard to tropical drums.</p><p>I remember the feeling that the group of people sitting in the garage of my home 501D were intrigued by me.</p><p>I remember imagining in the dream what I would look like if I went to the plaza where I would do tropical drums.</p><p>I remember that Ate Danielle and Kuya Glenn went before me.</p><p>I had many other dreams before this because I became half-awake several times and felt at each of them that I remembered dreams during each of those times.</p><p>I remember that there was the strange person was this guy that my mother made me go to. After probably giving him a large sum of money, he went to his group of thug-looking people and boss. I remember seeing a dead body that looked gray or white like ashes that formed the human body.</p><p>I remember him giving me several containers. One had plenty of rice and some tuna. Another had rice and maybe some or lots of tuna. Another had little tuna set in two lines in the much larger container.</p><p>I remember someone, probably Mom, telling me that it was disgusting to eat the &ldquo;soupy&rdquo; part of the tuna. I ate it away, either feeling or saying that it was food and that it was fine.</p><p>I remember Mom also saying or feeling that the food was too little for the money I paid.</p><p>In another scene or dream, I remember Ate Rica appearing with the name &ldquo;Jade&rdquo; in some video montage that I felt at one point consisted of their other people with similar getups.</p><p>I remember this play in the dream and there was this dude who was on a high platform who was trying to do magic but failing.</p><p>Probably, the play was supposed to be comedic.</p><p>I remember that the dude was saying incantations along the lines of &ldquo;Repair&rdquo; but ended up destroying part of the platform. It destroyed the platform in a square pattern I believe.</p><p>I remember this mage with a rod with light. I remember his face being lit orange from his light. He was passing through this transparent tunnel that seemed to be levitating.</p><p>I remember him probably going down onto a platform. The surrounding colors were mostly &ldquo;bluish&rdquo; and &ldquo;nightish.&rdquo; I remember this dude wearing white apparel.</p><p>I remember him beginning to bounce or jump only to jump within the blades of large scissors.</p><p>I remember Gwen from League of Legends and seeing the scissors that she held. She killed the mage I believe and then the camera went to center on her.</p><p>She looked at the camera, and then her face began to look like Rica either. I remember thinking that it might have been unfair to Crystal Jatayna, who in real life, was a cosplayer. When the camera centered on Rica, the scene faded into black with the word &ldquo;Jade&rdquo; appearing on the screen.</p><p>I forgot how the scene went from the platform with the play to the scene with the mage with a rod and then to Gwen who was apparently Ate Rica cosplaying.</p><p>4/7/2023 00:39 A note from ColorNote</p><p>The world is pure. In the middle of a dark forest, there is grace, and there is life.</p><p>I want to analyze a person&rsquo;s whole life.</p><p>I remember the first time and only time an aquaintance handed me an email for me to send them a friend request on Facebook. I forgot the older woman&rsquo;s name. It was during my first National Prayer Gathering I believe. I never got to meet her again after that, and I don&rsquo;t see her in my friend list.</p><p>I forgot many things, one of which is the reason for me deleting my old Youtube account &ldquo;SamyUi&rdquo; where I had 13 subscribers. Another is the reason for why I deleted my clips of my channel on KY Twitch account &ldquo;Yokseekan.&rdquo;</p><p>The Twitch channel name changed from &ldquo;Trialog,&rdquo; then &ldquo;Yoksikan,&rdquo; to—lastly
—&ldquo;Yokseekan.</p><p>I remember when I kept pronouncing &ldquo;Colonel&rdquo; as literally &ldquo;Co-lo-nel&rdquo; while playing Crossfire Online since that had ranks including Colonel. I remember Kuya Paulo and David repeatedly telling me the right pronounciation of &ldquo;Colonel.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember the children&rsquo;s game I played. The swing equipment at the park of Agro Homes Subd. had two slides on each side. We would go up the slides using the ladders on their opposite sides and go through a triangular opening that formed from the two legs on each side of the equipment. The two legs were angled diagonally and connected to one another at the top and through a bar near the top. This bar and the rest of the part around the top of each group of two legs formed the triangular opening. We would go through the opening of one of the two sides and jump onto the swing on that side. There were three swings in total in a line. We would use the chains to balance as we stood on the metal swing seats. We would swing it back and forth or side to side to create momentum and swing to the next swing and reach the other side of the swing equipment. In hindsight, this seemed dangerous, but the swings was only a little over a feet away from the ground. However, the triangular opening was a meter and probably a half from the ground. The whole equipment, including the slides, were made of metal. In short, the swing seats were linked up to chains attached to the gantry which comprised of the bar and the legs.</p><p>I believe this, along with the monkey bars, the three-sectioned pull-up bars, the seesaws, the low retaining walls which we used to play a balancing game and play tag, were helpful toward our understanding of our physical limits and how people interacted with one another in heightened situations. Of course, in this case, it was just play, but in a way, we were perhaps training for a physically intensive situation like those children&rsquo;s games.</p><p>There was this very thick circular retaining wall around a tree to the side of the swing equipment. We would travel from the slide to this wall and go onto a seesaw at the other side of this wall. The seesaw had a cylindrical base, which we traveled to and fro while standing.</p><p>In the other side of the swing equipment, we would go onto the monkey bars. The three-sectioned pull-up bars were too far away. We traveled from the mockey bars onto the nearby retaining wall of the entire playground.</p><p>I remember the &ldquo;kubo&rdquo; far off in another distinctive area surrounded by low, retaining walls. Three divided areas in total comprised the &ldquo;park&rdquo; area, including the playground area, the kubo area, and the area with only vegetation.</p><p>I remember Ram biking around the playground often and seeing Peter and Badjoy bike here too.</p><p>I believe it was David&rsquo;s transfer to MCA that changed much of the dynamics between the three of us.</p><p>The playground playing was probably before 2016. Maybe around 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and even further in the past.</p><p>I remember playing those children&rsquo;s games so many times with people from my original church, with classmates from NCA, and once or a few times with the children who attended the Daily Vacation Bible School.</p><p>I remember the former well with a higher retaining wall and the opening on the two opposite sides at the park.</p><p>I remember when we played that the game with the swing equipment that was basically the &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Touch the Ground&rdquo; game. I remember that we made it a rule that any tree roots, wood, or sticks on the ground could be traveled on rather than be elimitated when stepping onto it like the rest of the ground. We would pass from the seesaw to the tree without a retaining wall and go onto the retaining wall of the entire playground area.</p><p>We could go from this retaining wall to the retaining wall of the kubo area and the only vegetation area.</p><p>We would run and skip on those retaining walls because we would often try to get away from the person who was &ldquo;it&rdquo; while playing tag.</p><p>I remember tripping while standing on the retaining walls and hurting my knee and crying.</p><p>I remember that this was the park where I got hit on the head with a swing because Badjoy let go of the swing while we were making mounds of sand for sand castles or something. We might have brought some playground tools like a shovel and such. When I got hit, I bled and ran all the way from the park across the street next to the park and through the basketball court across another street to the mint-colored apartment where I saw the father of Shared and Desiree Evali squatting or something. The apartment was my home at the time, and I was hoping for help from my parents. When I was running through the basketball court, I remember hearing someone say &ldquo;Ew.&rdquo; I also remember that I couldn&rsquo;t see well due to the tears in my eyes.</p><p>I heard years later that the ground had the drops of blood from my forehead bleeding at the time.</p><p>I remember that Badjoy&rsquo;s father who lived in the same apartment drove me to the hospital because we didn&rsquo;t have a car at the time.</p><p>I remember the faint image of the nurse putting a bandage on my forehead. I forgot everything else but that.</p><p>I remember standing outside one of the churches from the church network. I was with Mark and the rest of the youth group from my original church I believe. This certain church was where I saw the mentally ill person mumbling and Ate Shimei singing on stage. I remember the darkness of the church. I think I remember that no one was particularly dancing or maybe I was wrong. I remember standing at the entrance of the church and seeing directly into the church and at Ate Shimei on stage. I think we were leaving or maybe we were hanging outside.</p><p>I forgot how long the event was at this church and what it was for.</p><p>I remember the various bathrooms that I&rsquo;ve visited throughout my life.</p><p>Whenever I remember something that had a big impact on my life and realizing that I had forgotten it for a very long time, I feel this ominous feeling.</p><p>I had such a big life.</p><p>Why?</p><p>I remember what it feels like to dance. I remember the feeling of going around and just following the steps. The speech choir was a lifetime for me. I felt like it was one of the most formative experiences of my life. It restored me to a place beyond nervousness and weakness. I use the word &ldquo;restored&rdquo; because it does feel like my life has existed at all times at once, as if I was not made into something but restored into it like time doesn&rsquo;t even exist properly.</p><p>I remember the feeling of practicing in the original church and listening to Tita Nhora. I remember the feeling of just getting to know the youth. I remember just being happy that Kelsey attended my original church and when she visited again years later. I remember feeling happy that some of my classmates from NCA attended the service of my original church, but they also soon left after one service or so.</p><p>I remember the faces of various different church members over the years. Even more so at TEAM Ministries, New Life Church, and a variety of other churches and events.</p><p>I remember the feeling of going to Agri Link with my mother and just listening to the speaker talk about trees. I felt estranged by the atmosphere of the older people and the older person speaking at the front. I was unfamiliar with the various things said, but at the same time, I realize now that most of what was said were very &ldquo;light&rdquo; compared to the more &ldquo;heavier&rdquo; stuff you would learn if you read textbooks.</p><p>I remember going to National Bookstore probably more than 6 months ago and buying the drawing pads that I have now. I remember that we planned to eat at Bonchon because it was too late to eat at the restaurants within the mall, but then, either my Dad or Mom said that it&rsquo;s better to eat at home instead. I remember that it was me, David, Mom, and Dad. I remember that Mom went somewhere else and I was looking for her at National Book Store for a while. I went up and down the elevator. I remember that we had come there probably to get my phone repaired, but I&rsquo;m not too sure. I remember carrying the paperbag for the drawing pads and feeling that they were heavy. When David handed me a large paper bag with these rolled paper when he went to the bathroom, I stood outside the bathroom, struggling to hold the items in hand. I remember holding my phone and recording horizontally. I think I got a look or two of inquiry. I remember wearing my brown corduroy jacket and desert pants. I remember imagining myself as a foreigner since I was holding the phone horizontally wherever I turned while inside the mall. I remember the feeling of holding my phone while walking out of the car. We crossed the little pedestrian from the parking lot to the mall. It was an SM Mall. I remember walking up one of two short, flight of stairs to the mall hallway. The floor was white, and the walls were yellowish white. I remember the billboards of people and the white and black mall kiosks in front of the Huawei repair center. I think I remember the person cutout at the entrance of the store next to the repair center. I remember the pure white of the way to the bathroom. I remember the glance from the cashier at National Book Store as I recorded, so I turned around, averting the phone from her.</p><p>I have the recording for this event stored privately and online on Youtube.</p><p>From the recording of the privated video titled &ldquo;human scene 3&rdquo;, David told me, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mom?&rdquo;</p><p>I remember that my mother wanted sharpeners, so Dad went and looked. I remember that my mother went away and returned to talk about certain sharpeners that were good. She remarked that it was the purely metal sharpeners that were good rather than the partially metal sharpeners or the plastic sharpeners.</p><p>From another recording titled &ldquo;human scene 5&rdquo;, apparently, we went to Starbucks.</p><p>I think I remember that my Dad said something that hurt me during the time recorded in the video titled &ldquo;human scene 4&rdquo;. I cannot look through it right now.</p><p>I remember the mint or candy that Mico Sebastian&rsquo;s mother gave me because I was dizzy while we were inside and at the back of an SUV for a NCA field trip. I remember the happiness I felt.</p><p>I remember the church that I only went to once for a morning prayer gathering. I remember that that was one of the first encounters I had with prayer gatherings and speaking in tongues I think. I remember that I was still getting used to it. I was with Tita Maris and Jeremiah, and I remember Jeremiah&rsquo;s unenthused way of raising his hand during a prayer. That didn&rsquo;t necessarily mean he was unwilling, but the particular way he held up his hand imprinted onto me. I remember the unskilled singing of Tita Maris. That was the only time I remember her particularly sounding off tune. Of course, later occasions showed that she did struggle to sing, but it was that moment where it was quite evident.</p><p>I remember watching Yosuga No Sora on Tita Maris&rsquo; phone and lying belly on my stomach on a coach in Jeremiah&rsquo;s old house. I remember that the room I was in at that time seemed to be the music room. I remember various other rooms in the house, but I forgot where this room was located specifically. I remember Ate Rica&rsquo;s room, Jeremiah&rsquo;s room, Kuya Mike&rsquo;s room, Tita Maris&rsquo; room, and Ate Priscilla&rsquo;s room, but I forgot the rest specifically. I remember the smell of the wooden main door and the flooring of the house. I remember that we went through a side door rather than the main door.</p><p>I remember the way Tita Maris nodded even during that time.</p><p>I remember swimming in Jeremiah&rsquo;s house plenty of times while I was there with him. I forgot what we did together exactly, but I remember sleeping in the same room as him. The only thing I know is that we most likely played video games.</p><p>It was only when I was in his new house that I discover Manga Rock because Jeremiah introduced it to me. That&rsquo;s when I began reading manga illegally. I and my family did watch One Piece illegally, but I never really read manga illegally.</p><p>I remember seeing David and Kuya Paulo illegally watch anime other than One Piece. I remember that Kuya Paulo was a fan of Fairy Tail.</p><p>I remember back at Jeremiah&rsquo;s old house that I slept in probably four different rooms: Ate Rica&rsquo;s room, what used to be Kuya Mike&rsquo;s room, Jeremiah&rsquo;s room, and probably Tita Maris&rsquo; room (but most likely not).</p><p>I remember playing Brawlhalla with Jeremiah with the two Switch controllers with the TV as the display.</p><p>I remember the fancy mirror, the numerous coaches, and the colored, cement statue of a dog in Jeremiah&rsquo;s old house. I remember the feeling of darkness and the gorgeousness and size of Jeremiah&rsquo;s house. I remember an orange light as I went up and down the flight of steps of Jeremiah&rsquo;s home. I remember the bathroom that I often ignored at the pool. I remember taking a dump there on time after I went for a swim. I remember the noise of people outside playing and talking.</p><p>I remember temporarily studying the paintings next to Ate Priscilla and Kuya Mike&rsquo;s rooms.</p><p>I remember that when we would go out, I would see Kuya Mike and Ate Priscilla go out of the rooms happily. I remember seeing the book &ldquo;The Five Waves&rdquo; when I passed or maybe peeked into Ate Rica&rsquo;s room. It was on a shelf attached to the wall I believe.</p><p>I remember that Kuya Mike was much more happier at this time, but I also remember that after what happened with his wife, I didn&rsquo;t think anything of it or expect Kuya Mike&rsquo;s behavior to change. I remember Timmy, the son of Kuya Mike.</p><p>I remember buying Jawbreaker and a lot of candies with Jeremiah at ATC. I remember going there along with Jeremiah&rsquo;s friends. I forgot who.</p><p>I remember being in the same house and room of one of Jeremiah&rsquo;s friends. I remember the pillow that lay on the bed which—I think—Jeremiah told me that his friend, the girl whose house we went to, used that pillow to masturbate. I remember that Jeremiah was lying down on the bed next to two girls I think</p><p>I remember that the girl, whose house we went to, picked a phone and began calling.</p><p>I remember hearing that she had sex with some guy. Hearing that made me scared because sex before marriage was taboo in my mind at the time. I remember that Jeremiah and I rode there and back. We got a ride from his chauffeur, who at the time was the female maid. I remember that one time, we wanted to go out, but she was busy driving Tita Maris outside.</p><p>I remember Jeremiah putting cinnamon on his coffee or choco at that old house.</p><p>I remember masturbating in that room where I watched Yosuga No Sora while Jeremiah went outs of the room. I think I got cockblocked by Jeremiah entering the room again several times before I successfully sexually climaxed.</p><p>I remember eating popcorn and then dropping it all over the floor after the bowl landed upside-down. I remember Kuya Mike sternly telling me that I should leave it to the available maid, who at the time was this woman who happened to be cross-eyed, rather than the maid who also acted as chauffeur. I remember Kuya Mike telling me something among the lines of &ldquo;That&rsquo;s their (maids) job. Don&rsquo;t do their job.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember feeling nervous and shocked culturally by that incident. Whenever I would remember this incident much time later, I would often accompany it to me washing dishes and cooking rice as a way to compare the differences in family culture and values.</p><p>I remember Pastor John Hilapo From MCA asking me if I cooked rice during a routinary prayer meeting after roll call where we recited these weird &ldquo;manifestating&rdquo; lines like &ldquo;I will become financially full for the rest of my life&rdquo; or something like that. I remember answering his rice question with a yes. He even asked me how to cook it then. I told him that I would wash the rice to clean it, then put rice and then put twice as much water as the rice. Pastor John was about to finish his statement (I think) about water only needing to be as much as the rice when I clarified that the aforementioned rice I cooked was brown rice, which required the double the water. I remember Pastor John possibly telling me about a minor error in my statement about how to cook rice or maybe the atmosphere was so tense I thought that was the case. I remember seeing the back of various students: this dude with the glasses, that girl with the glasses, that girl with the ponytail, Ashley, and Derrick Capistrano who was that dude who looked like a basketball player in hairstyle, among others.</p><p>I remember feeling that being the representative, if not one of the representatives, of my class and being part of this strange repeating of manifestations at the adjacent room of the assembly area. I remember the feeling of elegance, sophistication, and privilege.</p><p>I remember the various emotions I felt during the youth camps orchestrated within the Nazarene church network. It was full of life, and MCA shouldn&rsquo;t have been any different or a learning experience. However, MCA was a cultural shock like a shotgun load on my face.</p><p>I remember eating with Ram and Badjoy a year or two ago at this place in Agro Homes with &ldquo;Dragon&rdquo; in its name where we could eat unlimited chicken if I remember correctly.</p><p>I remember eating with them even much farther back before this at Wingbites where we ate unlimited wings. I believe we ate there twice together. The second time, we ate with Peter as well.</p><p>I remember this strong dude with a ponytail at the gym that Jeremiah attended before. I remember Tita Maris signing me up along with Jeremiah. I remember a dude with glasses and the coach whom we deferred to.</p><p>I had a dream where I was watching an anime.</p><p>I remember seeing an older man dressed as a maid I think. In the anime, the main protagonist was drawn like an anime character along with the maid. I remember they were in a dark, mansion-looking house. Though, I saw the smaller room rather than the large lobby. The design of the room the two characters were in was designed like a mansion. It looked like a vampire&rsquo;s home from how dark it was. I remember that the main character looked like a typical black-haired protagonist, but I think he had some oddities and extra design features on his face. I think the way he dressed was like the protagonist from Gluttony something. I remember that he thought that the older man was his father, so he called him &ldquo;Father&rdquo; or something. I remember thinking that people liked this anime. I remember seeing rotoscoping of the main character. I remember when the main character asked the older man to go outside and buy something, the older man used magic to create something I think. I remember that the main protagonist responded by magically turning that thing that the older man created into something else or destroyed it. The older man reacted by either turning the thing into another thing or summoned a new thing. I remember that the older man once turned the thing into many monstrous critters that probably had the shape of a piranha&rsquo;s base head with legs and without fins.</p><p>I remember wanting to lie down on the floor many times since I prefer sleeping on the floor, but I refrained ultimately out of a desire to fit in. In conclusion, I lay down on the various beds.</p><p>I remember the sound of the wooden floor in Jeremiah&rsquo;s old house when one tapped onto it.</p><p>I remember the feeling of lying down in the big room where we played Smash Bros (I think). I remember the various bedding on the floor whenever there were many of us. I think this was before the kissing incident between Jeremiah and Jhon Paul.</p><p>I remember when I became president of MCA in the classroom after the voting. I remember feeling surprised. I think, at the time, the seat arrangement was very casual, as we directed our chairs outward from our own desks.</p><p>I remember the first nervous steps I made toward the school for the first few weeks or months or so. I remember the feeling of just walking all the way from home to ease my nervousness. I assume that I rode the jeep only when there was a deadline that I struggled with.</p><p>I remember the feeling of not talking to Aidan, Robyn, and Andrei at first and just listening to their casual conversations at the cafeteria I think. I remember thinking that Aidan Mercado and Tristan Acquino were brothers. I remember hearing the confused, curious questions regarding my regular prayer before eating at lunchbreaks.</p><p>I remember feeling that the first lunchbreaks were so formative to my understanding of the manifold students.</p><p>I remember not being accustomed to the timing of the lunchbreaks.</p><p>The first girl I was probably somewhat intrigued by was Ciara, but maybe it was more so because she had a somewhat tall, somewhat thin figure to me at the time. Besides that, I never really looked at girls that way until months later with Lauren.</p><p>I think I remember when seeing Neo Bregente and Juan Gutierrez talking often.</p><p>I remember seeing Juan wearing his blue-framed glasses and putting it down when he went to sleep during lunchbreaks or even during class.</p><p>I remember sitting down so many times on the bench in front of the classroom. I remember the feeling of putting down my bag and looking through my things there I think. I remember when that room in front of the two classrooms of Grade 7 to 8 and Grade 9 to 10 was filled with students after roll call and before or after some field trip maybe.</p><p>I remember beginning to notice Jade Carlit after roll call after she talked to me once or a few times. I thought she was a nice person, which was why I wanted to be friends with her even after I quit school. I think she wrongly took it as romantic infatuation because I&rsquo;m bad at talking to people through text. This is why I always give boring, straight answers like &ldquo;Ok.&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s much easier. I also talked to the girls because I believed they would be more accepting toward discussing less common interests instead of only basketball, shoes, cars, and funny sexual stories like the boys I got close to tended to do. I wanted to have a friend because I was going through a hard time. Getting blocked by Jade was one of many wake-up calls to give up making friends and focus on improving myself. I noticed Jade Carlit while we were lined up in front of our classrooms because we generally go at the same time. I think I was always positioned to align closely with Jade, so I think that allowed me to notice her.</p><p>I remember getting closer to Makki on a field trip because I was seated right next to him. He would wear headphones I believe.</p><p>I remember seeing the back of the somewhat tall student, the dude with the shark-looking face, while we were seated and at the field trip. I think he was seated beside Jared.</p><p>I remember later on when I got closer to the trio that Aidan told me not to have my pinky up while holding a cup.</p><p>I remember that girl who stared at me while I was seated next to her at lunch break. I just ignored her because &ldquo;Come on, man! Why you gotta do me like this!&rdquo; were probably my thoughts at the time.</p><p>I remember the dude who attended the school late and quit school because the trio along with the rest of the class often teased him. He struggled with it.</p><p>I remember Enzo who attended school late and played electric guitar well. I remember Sir Marvin who played the drums. I forgot the student who played the drums. I remember Abi Bilog singing and even Chieka Lyka Barcelona singing I think. I remember the brother of Lyka singing all the time as well. I remember being made to sing in the classroom during some lunch break.</p><p>At times, the lunchbreaks involved sleeping and darkness afterwards, and at other times, during lunchbreaks, the room was bright with the assistant teachers talking together.</p><p>I remember when I saw and heard Lyka&rsquo;s brother say that one shouldn&rsquo;t eat chocolate before singing. I think it was around the time I sold graham balls. He ended up buying a lot of graham balls I remember.</p><p>I remember that Robyn would go around standing like his back was bent, but then I soon learned that he had scoliosis. It was even more susprising since he ran fast while playing basketball.</p><p>I remember Andrei being the class clown along with Paula and Aidan. Sometimes, I&rsquo;d hear Juan joke too.</p><p>I remember when Lyka teased Teacher Marvin on his deep-set eyes and the unamused gaze he gave her.</p><p>I remember being told to play basketball with them since they said that I looked strong and big, but then they realized I was bad like I said I was. Same went for Enzo.</p><p>I remember when Teacher Marvin made us shoot basketballs from the either the two-point line or a much closer line as our PE Exam.</p><p>I remember when we planted plants and seeds for Agriculture something with the short teacher with glasses.</p><p>I remember that Grade 7 got a special set of classes that was different from Grade 8&rsquo;s.</p><p>My teacher at the time during NCA before transferring to Grade 1 was Teacher Ruth, the former girlfriend of Coach Ryan who used to be our coach for Sports Fests. After looking at some older pictures, I learned that my classmates were EK Halili, Cheenie, Clarence, Joanna, Miko, and Jared during 2012.</p><p>I remember seeing the trees further up in Agro Homes that dropped this weird nut-looking objects that you could peel the soft skin off. It was red inside.</p><p>The plants in my village or subdivision included Banana Tree, Areca Palm, Papaya Tree, Dracaena reflexa, Frangipani, probably dragon tree, Christmas Palm, Premna serratifolia, Broad-leaved Yellowwood, Golden-trumpet, Lantana, Sanchezia oblonga, Weeping fig, Queen&rsquo;s crape-myrtle, Rottboellia cochinchinensis, white mulberry (no fruit), Chinese-laurel, Monoon longifolium (the false ashoka), Small-leaved dragon tree, Wild frangipani, Fukien-tea, Big-leaf podocarp, Desert wild grape, Darwin black wattle, Beleric myrobalan, Dutchman&rsquo;s-pipe, probably Leucophyllum frutescens (Texas barometer bush), Golden dewdrops, Ipil-ipil, Abyssinian Rhodes grass, Ficus hispida (Hairy fig), Ficus erecta, Ficus virgata (Figwood), Indian acalypha, Jatropha integerrima (Perigrina), Ivy gourd, Albizia lebbeck, Ixora chinensis (Chinese ixora), Orchid Tree, Neem, Dracaena cambodiana (Cambodian Dragon Tree), Blushing philodendron, Queensland umbrella tree, Okra plant, Cucumber plant, possibly calabash (upo) plant, Tulasi, Red mulberry plant, Guava tree, Tamarind plant or Moringa plant, Great Bindweed, Operculina turpethum plant, Tridax procumbens (Dagad-phul), Muntingia calabura (Calabur-tree), Limnophila rugosa plant, Buffalograss, Ficus ingens, Euphorbia hirta (Asthmaplant), probably Chickenweed, and probably Carex pilulifera (Pill sedge).</p><p>I remember when I put a plant and taped it onto a paper for a school project in NCA. I remember placing it at the wall of my desk where I would put the two flags for scoring my work and getting special assistance from teacher.</p><p>I wish I had the blueprints to every house.</p><p>I remember the feeling of the drizzly weather while I was at a camp or event at Baguio. I remember looking outside and walking around in the dark. I remember the loud sound of rain in the morning when I just woke up. I remember waking up at dark 5 AM and hanging out with inside the indoors assembly area. The people who were waking up and going to this area grew as the morning grew brighter.</p><p>I remember the numerous DVDS and CDs we bought and watched over the years. From what I remember seeing, we bought over a hundred CDs.</p><p>I remember the feeling of heading to Video City and then buying Puto bumbong from a lady there who had this metal equipment purposed for making Puto bumbong.</p><p>I remember the various snacks we ate: biko, puto bumbong, puto, ube, crinkle cookies, Lemon crinkle cookies, Red Velvet Crinkle Cookies, cheesecakes, Fudgee bar, Hansel biscuit, Taho, pan de sal, Bibingkang malagkit, Suman, Kutsinta, Ginataang mais, Piaya, Sorbetes, Polvoron, Chicharon, Potato chips, Corn chips, Cheese-flavoured chips, Potchi, Chocnut, Hany, Dried Mangoes, Instant pancit canton, and shrimp chips, banana chips, among others.</p><p>My favorite chips were Tattoos Chips, Oishi&rsquo;s Tomato Ketchup Potato Fries, and Tomi Corn Chips, among others.</p><p>There was this old potato chips brand that I and my family used to buy and liked, but it disappeared.</p><p>I remember the feeling of sitting down in a movie theater and feeling the aircon and the infinitesimal weight of the echoes when people spoke. The scentless bathrooms right after the entrance and right before the theater seats were a haven when I needed to leave and urinate. I think I only took a dump once at a movie theater restroom.</p><p>I remember eating many times with Tita Maris at ATC.</p><p>I remember eating lots of eggs from the cafeteria at an event at what I believe is Baguio. I remember the American speaker who was there and ate with me and my mother. That was probably the first time I looked at eggs and thought they were luxurious since there was so many eggs in one large container. I was probably in a camp, but I was only accompanying my mother, who was most likely a speaker.</p><p>I remember the smell of tahong at an extended family gathering with my Dad&rsquo;s relatives. I remember disliking tahong and preferring to eat the pork that I remember the catering staff cutting the whole, cooked pig. Once I ate the pig, I remember surprised that the taste was not as good as I thought.</p><p>I believe I have the pictures that we took after this gathering ended.</p><p>I remember the ice-breaker games played in another gathering with Dad&rsquo;s relatives, probably the same gathering, but I remember this one being different because of the orange lights and it being rather indoors with the windows covered instead. I remember feeling quite awkward because I was not close with my relatives and their associates anyway. I think I still joined in after being convinced after many tries. I had this reluctant disposition at the time.</p><p>The gathering before the current one mentioned was naturally bright and had windows for walls to one side.</p><p>I remember the various toys we had that we played and pretended with. The toy penguin, the wolf toy, and the car toy, among others. In terms of color, the 13-centimeter-tall, 10.2-centimeter-long penguin had a #D7D8DA belly and bottom sides of the fins, #CCBA3C bill and feet, and a #49A3BE back, bottom, and top sides of the fins. It had a wingspan of 17 centimeters (cm). It had black, plastic eyes. As for the feet, they were 3.7 cm long, 3 cm wide, and 1.3 cm tall. Rather than webbed toes, they had what looked like 3-toed paws. They had a black line on their beak that represented their mouth. This line was thicker around the sides and very, very thin around the middle.</p><p>I remember the various hats I wore, including the Australia hat I wore before my growth spurt.</p><p>I remember learning that Ate Rica liked Eminem while we listened to Eminem in Kuya Mike&rsquo;s car while going home from the dinner we had along with Kuya Paulo, Ate Danielle, and Kuya Glenn. This dinner was the one where I thought Ate Rica&rsquo;s ponytail looked much like Lauren, and I found myself temporarily infatuated with the lookalike.</p><p>I remember the enlightened feeling of listening to Eminem along with Kuya Mike. That was one of the first times I began to connect to Kuya Mike. I began to like listening to Eminem soon after. I also connected to Kuya Mike through our talk about the age gap between me and my crush from New Life Church. I also remember we talked about writing, and that&rsquo;s when Kuya Mike told me about the multiverse he had in mind where each world was in a different genre and time period. Those were clear moments where I felt a connection to Kuya Mike.</p><p>It was scary listening to Eminem in such an enclosed environment in the car because he swore a lot. That was before I began to swear myself not out of rage or anger but just casually without malice. The casual way Americans do it. The F-word is now like an energized way to say &ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; among other things.</p><p>I remember getting irritated by the berating toward Timothy clumsily dropping plates or cups and breaking them in the process. I used to feel insecure about being clumsy too, and I was getting irritated by the idea that Timothy might develop that. I think it was my older half-sister, Ate Danielle, who did the most bickering toward Timothy. It was horrific to listen to her voice, and I hated learning that she was apparently bullied when she doesn&rsquo;t even know how to scold people gracefully. Of course, many other factors played into Timothy developing some fixations and insecurity, but oh did I feel irritated by that specific manner of doing it.</p><p>I&rsquo;m okay with people scolding their children or siblings, but it really depends on the tone. Sometimes, it just sounds ungraceful and full of abrasiveness and a pretentiousness with gaining power, authority, and responsibility—pride in a false sense of maturity. I have exhibited this and continue to exhibit it, so I am a hypocrite. I admit I speak of wanting to improve myself, but I clearly show immaturity and maldevelopment. I admit that I am a hypocrite for wanting to improve myself even though I am still evidently underdeveloped in many aspects. I say I hate certain things and dislike certain things, but many times have I showed contradiction to those values, which is why I&rsquo;ve grown motivated over the years. The fixations I&rsquo;ve developed as a result, and the heightened level of faith I had in God to the point of genuinely believing that our debt would go away—the feeling of shame because I was clearly a weak vessel, but I wanted to behold and grace the presence of hope and goodness. I wanted to become a good person, but I have failed by failing to act when a child was drowning (metaphorically), when evil was manifesting, and when people were getting away with it. I feel that I am evil and a hypocrite because I am not perfect and have shown myself to hide and do nothing in the face of the people I trusted to be good turning around and showing their malevolent sides against my more vulnerable brethren. I am a weakling, but the pride and the cowardice I exhibit not to end my life is immense. I am the most arrogant piece of human to think even try because what I am fighting is the unknown. I am no longer a Christian, which means that everything around me will be studied with facts but mostly scientific, predictive models, which are inherently not going to capture the definition of the entirety of everything at all times. Even with our models that underlie our knowledge of the world, we lack the ability to monitor the information, details, and state of everything at once. I live believing this, and yet, I have to keep going. I keep going ultimately.</p><p>This is a snippet of my philosophy or manner of belief, which is all just inherently common and uninteresting if one briefly compared me to the vastness of human value as evidenced by the idea of human rather than an individual or the entirety, but the human simple ideal and physical and inner complexities within. The grandness of human experience shall never be weighed, as human value is present in all human beings. Human value is thus a placating force unto me. I find that I am common, and I am normal, within which the reduction of the fear of being special and the expectations therewith has begun.</p><p>I remember hanging out with people who are good with constructive criticism but are not good at showing that they care, which creates this strange attachment of &ldquo;I want to improve myself, but it hurts when they just focus on my flaws and show little interest when I finally achieve the goals they set for me.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember that at the camp where I ate the &ldquo;luxurious eggs,&rdquo; I remember being there along with probably GB and Tita April, the mother of GB.</p><p>I remember that at MCA, we had to give our phones and put them in a container. I remember that I often didn&rsquo;t bring a phone because of this. I remember one of several situations where not bringing my phone became a minor issue.</p><p>I remember the ugly, brown walls of the classroom in NCA. I remember that this classroom was built while I was attending. After NCA was gone, it became used as an office I believe and then a storage room.</p><p>I remember</p><p>I realize now there&rsquo;s no simple model that one can use to handle social situations with people entirely or handle medical situations with people entirely. Specific, rare details and anecdotal knowledge are crucial.</p><p>Understanding others medically and socially is an active, methodological assimilation of details and overarching agents like the economy, atmosphere, ecology, and legalities, among others.</p><p>In the end, reading books is only a model because even the authors of these books rely on an anecdotal understanding—an understanding that is inherently a model itself—of themselves and various subject matters.</p><p>&ldquo;Therefore, even books are not immune to the inherent limitations of any model, which is based on interpretations and the individual perspectives of its creators.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember reading the book of Heidi for Literature and Creative Writing textbook in the ACE PACEs learning system. I remember the feeling that I was stuck in a dream. I think I remember watching a movie about Heidi or something. I tried searching, but I don&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re familiar.</p><p>I remember watching the film &ldquo;The Cross and the Switchblade&rdquo;. It felt like being stuck in a dream where I couldn&rsquo;t escape. I saw the various expressions and cries of the characters. I saw them running around and just feeling this weird feeling. Trying to remembe rmy life at the time of watching the film gives me a strange feeling, but I have forgotten it. I remember the girl who was on the bed and they were trying to exorcise her. I remember it was drugs or something. I remember them going into some underground place or something, but that&rsquo;s all I remember. I remember watching this on the old TV I think. I have a feeling that I might have watched this film with the children from DVBS or maybe the teens from the youth group from my original church. Maybe I watched elsewhere at my original church instead of at home.</p><p>Honestly, listening to this video is relaxing. It combines the song Telephones by the band Vacations and audio lines by the character Joker from the film Joker (2019) and the DC Comics Universe. The laughter voiced by the character Joker reminds me of the feeling of acceptance and resignment that I want to feel toward the sense of impossibility of trying to document everything from my past. It just feels too vast at times, but I know this is a temporary affect or emotion, which the video and music validates.</p><p>After searching, I remember reading other ACE books like The Red Rag Riddle, Children&rsquo;s Missionary Library, Christians Courageous.</p><p>I remember the strange feeling of looking at the cartoonish mascot in the Literature and Creative Writing PACEs.</p><p>I remember cheating on my Social Studies twice. I remember cheating when I was still attending NCA once, and then I lied about it. But after that, I didn&rsquo;t cheat again until I became homeschooled. I remember just writing gibberish on all the vacant answer lines of my PACEs and pretending that the PACE was done.</p><p>My mother would often go outside, and I had time to be alone, which gave me time to start experimenting with myself. I think that&rsquo;s when I began masturbating without realizing it. I didn&rsquo;t read or watch any kind of pornographic material until much later on.</p><p>When I did, it started with getting attracted to the scene in Along Came Polly where Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston awkwardly kissed and Ben Stiller went to the bathroom or something midway. I remember watching it on Vimeo after struggling to find it or maybe a good quality clip of it, which is hilarious to me in hindsight.</p><p>I remember seeing my NCA classmate Joecel Constantino cheating on the scoring table when I went to score or maybe he looked like he was about to cheat. He got caught cheating probably more times than one.</p><p>It was surreal encountering again the ACE learning classroom environment with the two flags and everything again at MCA after becoming homeschooled for a while since my exit from NCA. I want to say that being homeschooled gave me time and space to explore things like coding or programming on Roblox, making contraptions in the physics engine Incredibots, learning how to play guitar and sing, dancing, exercising, hiking, growing interpersonally and socially through very frequent interactions with my original church mates, among other activites and developments. I was able even to be part of the Daily Vacation Bible School where we taught kids, which is why I never really felt regret. Now, that I&rsquo;m thinking logically, I realize that my logic too verifies my emotional reaction of calm toward my homeschooled life. Or in this case, &ldquo;Internet-schooled,&rdquo; &ldquo;computer-schooled,&rdquo; &ldquo;church-schooled,&rdquo; &ldquo;volunteer-schooled,&rdquo; &ldquo;camp-schooled,&rdquo; and &ldquo;people-schooled,&rdquo; among others. I take pride in that experience and boast it because I believe that a more beneficial mode of growth involves having manifold experiences implicating the interpersonal complexities and inner intricacies of people rather than solely staying cooped up studying scientific models.</p><p>I remember the feeling of going through the byzantine routes and home shapes and social structures of the people in the &ldquo;Squatter&rsquo;s Area&rdquo; in Alabang and at this other place in Putatan past the Bliss Court called &ldquo;Tower&rdquo; high and deep within the ungated, open community. The variety of different sitting positions that people adopted and the various ways people expressed themselves intrigued me. It felt bereft of moral complexity if one adopted the lens of most narratives, but to me, in hindsight, the complexities of humans was evident from the way that people navigated the seeming permanence of the structural integrities of the connected dark-gray cement structures and the vastness of human experience with all its &ldquo;serrated&rdquo; needs.</p><p>I remember hearing about a story where a child got run over while my mother was bringing them to a children&rsquo;s church service. I may be incorrect in my interpretation because it sounds like a heavy topic and I could have ignored anything else said after the initial revelation, potentially resulting in a misunderstanding.</p><p>I remember the feeling of buying violin for the first time and just relishing in the expression of weakness that I exhibited through my unskillful playing, yet I played vehemently and passionately as if I was playing to the audience of the world. I had a great connection to weakness, as feelings of humiliation and shame accompanied the factors of my graceful, formative growth and development.</p><p>I remember attending a concert with Ate Priscilla and probably Ate Danielle and Jeremiah and just enjoying the feeling of walking through the streets. The Christian band &ldquo;Planet Shakers&rdquo; held this concert at Araneta Coliseum. It was heavenly like a tidal wave crashing down and swallowing all my burdersome wickedness. I enjoyed the feeling of flying through the air as the atmospheric, drizzly, and cold embrace of the city entertained me, making me walk my feet in joy.</p><p>I remember the feeling of stomping my feet as I cried &ldquo;Holy, Holy, is the Lord God Almighty!&rdquo; many times during the several times I attended National Prayer Gathering at Araneta Coliseum. I was enthralled and in vehement acceptance of the light of peace.</p><p>I remember the feeling of taking copious notes at various events in NYI (Nazarene Youth Internetational), including the camps and such.</p><p>I remember eating with Clarence a lot during lunchbreak, or maybe it was EK. I remember someone had black rice. It was probably Jared.</p><p>I remember seeing Raven, one of my former NCA classmates, somewhere outside probably before, during, or after going to a mall many years ago as of writing. I think I remember searching him up on Facebook afterwards.</p><p>I remember playing the piano from time to time at my original church because I really wanted to try it. As of writing, I want to buy it, so I can diversify my activities to reduce diminishing returns due to some activites only requiring one hour everyday. I&rsquo;ve already proven many times to be able to do one activity for borderline the rest of the day for around 12 to 14 hours even at home. This began relatively recently.</p><p>My first year (2018 to 2019) after quitting MCA was marked by behaviors that closely aligned with depression but also growth in the areas such as fiction reading. This allowed me to forget a great sum of my earlier life before MCA and focus on church. The next years were marked by motivitation and an upward growth toward healthier behaviors, often enforcing healthy habits. I suffered immensely during this self-enforcement of healthy behavior. The second or third year included my breaking away from Christianity and toward atheism, which happened over the course of many months. I had developed a strong connection with New Life Church by that time, and the breaking away was uncomfortable and confusing. During my enforcement of healthy behavior, forcing myself to eat vegetables was one such method evident in my recollections.</p><p>I had forgotten many things. I had forgotten the memories of playing at D&rsquo;Cup. I had forgotten the every event that happened in NCA.</p><p>I remember the distinctive ways my MCA classmates walked throughout the school year: Lauren, Kyra, Aidan, among others.</p><p>Lauren walked with still, angled arms pointing forward and seemingly primed to handle hand-operated, manual tasks, with balanced but plain footsteps, exhibiting greatly reduced intricacy of overall body movement, rotation, and the sequential, rolling wave in which the body tends to move when adopting elegance and gracefulness, and with an openly curious bearing. Her tied, easy-done ponytail hair enhanced this &ldquo;not taking oneself seriously&rdquo; practical outward nature. Finally, her periodic untying only when she was relaxed and inactive furthered her demeanor of sincerity.</p><p>Sophia &ldquo;Kyra&rdquo; Capistrano walked with short footsteps despite her cunning in sports, specifically volleyball and running, which would usually imply a more open stance full of suppressed energy. Her gait along with her usually long untied hair exuded an elegance that radiated downwards rather than wavy or back-and-forth or upwards like an introverted priestess poised for saintly activities. She would often brush her hair confidently as she walked, which promoted the sense that her manner of movement exhibited intentionality. Yet, when looking from afar and from her perspective herself, her &ldquo;downward,&rdquo; reserved manner of elegance would seem like simplicity rather than a poised attack as she would demonstrate while playing sports.</p><p>When Aidan ran, he often gently balled his hands into fists. His gait was refined in a sports standard sense, as if all personality had been taken only to be replaced with refinement for the sake of sports. His facial expression and the way he lifted his arms while walking were the only identifiers of a personality within. He had his shoulders raised and arms pointed like he was posing for a propaganda poster. His steps were contrastingly reduced to mere inconspicuous fragments by the effort in which he raised his shoulders as if he was standing for a photo following a political life.</p><p>They have changed much since then, but only in confidence rather than with &ldquo;outward personality&rdquo; as well. Their lives were uninterrupted and undisrupted mostly, which made a significant change of the specific subset of the outward personality highly unlikely. This is mostly a gross distortion of the truth, as humans are inherently a byzantine stronghold of inner complexities incredibly difficult to penetrate intellectually.</p><p>In short, this analysis was a reflection of my subjective experience rather than a 100% accurate understanding of the three students. Supplementing this predictive model into your own model for comprehending specifically this subset of people and people in general would be beneficial.</p><p>Anyway, this book will continue to exegete the various emotions and affects—among others—of people and even a focus on certain subsets of people, but this brief expository account should be sufficient as a foretaste of the &ldquo;socio-psychophysiological&rdquo; delineations.</p><p>I remember playing volleyball with my original church and with the church members from the many churches part of the church network many times. I remember playing with some church members from New Life Church.</p><p>I remember waking up in the morning and just reading the book &ldquo;I Am a Hero&rdquo; or the myriad other books that I&rsquo;ve read in the past.</p><p>I remember the feeling of seeing the gates of MCA close. I also remember the gates of my original church open and close for cars. I remember when a bunch of cars lined up outside it, which was rare and probably only during certain events.</p><p>I remember the feeling of listening to various Filipino rappers from manifold people throughout my life.</p><p>I remember drilling holes into the wall and screwed the current shelf that I have in my room. I remember putting together the various parts of the purchased pull-up stand and screwed them together according to the holes already set around the stand.</p><p>I remember the feeling of walking down the wet slope in the mountains in the night. The feeling of the rain pouring was divine like the sky was warping itself to consume me and the other people trekking alongside me. We felt like beasts of the night looking for human shelter, guided only by the still-faced tour guides we had. Of course, this feeling only briefly and intermittently appeared when the mood hit right.</p><p>I remember the expressions of the various people I was with. I remember the distant smile of the 30s-looking Ody who looked like she was trying to live life on her own terms like the rest of us. The hike revealed the strength we had within us, as those who came had the strength to come.</p><p>Those who persisted were even stronger. I can only name one person—Lorelie, a youth from my original church. She fainted often and struggled with the heat, but she was a very active participant in our activities, including outdoors where it was tropically hot.</p><p>I remember the growing hatred I had toward the feeling of weakness I had. I hated the idea of falling apart without trying. I felt like I had to fight. Every piece of media that I found beautiful bolstered this feeling. I despised the idea that this beautiful thing would left unappreciated. I felt that only looking at it was insufficient to appreciate it. I felt that so much more had to done. I had to find manifold ways to express the feeling that I had toward it. I had to learn and understand everything around me, so I could see the beauty. At the same time, I recognized that even though someone is ignorant in many things, that shouldn&rsquo;t remove the worth of their experience when appreciating beautiful things. They matter, but simultaneously, I felt that I had to improve myself. I felt that I had to try.</p><p>This feeling was evident in many occasions, including after I watched the anime series Violet Evergarden.</p><p>I remember slamming my hips with a spoon because I felt so much pain inside and needed a way to express it. Since then, I&rsquo;ve found better and healthier ways to cope.</p><p>I recognize that people are so capable of living through models that they will utilize a character they watched and read about to understand other concepts. So linking concepts and ideas to various, popular characters, among other identifier-models, fosters ease of communication.</p><p>I remember that every time I would go on a rage episode, I would scream out, &ldquo;I trusted you!&rdquo; My father didn&rsquo;t understand it. He didn&rsquo;t understand that even after he made me badly cry right in front of him so many times for so many years. My earliest memory of him was my mother making me apologize to him even if I didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong but because he perceived my action as disrespectful. I believed that it was my fault all the time and that my weakness was the only reason for him disliking me. I later learned that he took this manner of humiliated, defeated crying as a good sign that he was a good father. When he began to ask me what specific things he did that made me see him unfavorably, I couldn&rsquo;t say anything. I was just so compounded by the idea that after all those years, he couldn&rsquo;t even get himself to recognize his evil. My father was a significant factor in my formative development. It is difficult to believe that I am a victim, as I have forcibly convinced myself to believe in intentionality, willpower, taking action responsibly, and, principally, the self-directive to keep going on as a way to face the conflicts and dissonances within me.</p><p>One idea that I&rsquo;ve committed to a level of &ldquo;fact&rdquo; in my mind is the nothingness that I am as emotionally imprinted by my father. Through his behavior, he taught me that I am nothing and, thus, the only thing I can do is keep going and do the right thing. I would ask the question, &ldquo;How can I feel pride?&rdquo; because I felt that I was nothing. My confident, determined behavior and expressions is a reflection of me breaking away who I have used to be in order to become the person that I want to become, that I believe people wanted me to become, and that I believe my father wanted me to become. The &ldquo;person that I wanted to become&rdquo; is &ldquo;perfection.&rdquo;</p><p>I say grandiose statements like &ldquo;I shall become perfection.&rdquo; and &ldquo;I shall become the epitome of grace and beauty.&rdquo; I remember neurotically typing down these statements again and again on my computer while alone in the room. I struggled to express myself directly, as I wished for privacy after realizing that my words were even being analyzed and misconstrued. My father hit me and shouted various remarks like &ldquo;I could have lived a happy life if I didn&rsquo;t have kids.&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so tired of these kids.&rdquo; without swearing. He never apologized. He would often talk about his bully older brother, and for many years, I believed him. As time passed, I started to see this inseparable bond between victim and perpetrator in my father. I soon started to believe that I would not become different from my father and declaring otherwise was hypocrisy. I would say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a good guy. I&rsquo;m no different from him. I just have to do the right thing anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember laughing so hard when my brain somehow realized how useless it was to cry because he showed no empathy and only sadistic gloating at me crying. I realized that he only felt bad when he believed that I was making him look bad. He believed in appearances and exhibited classist expressions, which he exhibited when he made me go outside when I was crying so I could feel ashamed and stop crying. He gave the impression of a cynic who thought people were stupid and disrespectful and only cared about appearances.</p><p>The smirk and laugh that he did scared me the most. Even his casual voice made me tremble for most times of my life. When he adopted a complaining tone, it scared me even more. I would want to hide in a corner of the wall and just hyperventilate. Anytime I got flashbacks to my father talking, I would experience terror, which I tried to inhibit as much as I could. I suppressed so much emotions and never showed the kind of rage that I showed only recently. After suppressing myself for so long, I broke and began to laugh even when neighbors heard. For a long time, I would stare outside past the screen door or the window when I felt a sense of intense hurt and loss.</p><p>I tried to kill myself twice, and I declared that I would kill my father many times.</p><p>My father still looks at me the same way, but it&rsquo;s much calmer now that I&rsquo;ve learned how to cope and manage my emotions after many, many years. He was only one factor, and I&rsquo;m not a victim.</p><p>I remember bursting into rage when I saw my father berating my brother David who was already struggling so much with insecurity.</p><p>Now, it&rsquo;s like he pretends as if David was insecure for no reason.</p><p>My mother was neglectful toward us, her children, and allowed the insecurities of my eldest half-brother to foster and turn into bullying and emotional abuse toward his younger brothers. My eldest half-sister also had a similar effect on us, especially Timothy. I remember the tone she used when she tried to hide the boyfriend she wasn&rsquo;t allowed to have. She used the same pretentious mature tone every single time she scolded Timothy. I hated it. The hypocrisy.</p><p>Seeing so much hypocrisy fostered the desire for uprightness and moral integrity already in me. I grew up going to many Christian churches and events and listening to messages of moral integrity and honesty all the time and found community, friendship, and growth there.</p><p>I remember the innocent expressions of David, my youngest brother Timothy, and my second-to-youngest brother Peter being torn away from them over the years.</p><p>I had promised myself many times that I would kill to save, but I&rsquo;m much more calmer now I think.</p><p>I&rsquo;m tired of watching people get hurt and then trusting hypocrites all my life, which is why I decided many times that I will kill myself if I am sure I am a horrible being incapable of being saved.</p><p>I even said, &ldquo;If I am horrible [without hope and without any chance at doing good things and helping others], please kill me.&rdquo;</p><p>These experiences, among many others, have been essential to my current identity. This autobiography will hopefully improve upon this person that I am by representing myself and my subjective experiences as accurately and detailed as possible. This will be consistent with honesty, if not moral integrity and honesty.</p><p>I remember crying and holding it in for so long. So many years. I was the most timid in the person in the world. I was so scared. My rage is my savior and where I can truly express myself. I am free in my rabid expressions. I am myself. I feel that I can finally do the right thing after watching so many people suffer. The concept of killing Evil sounded so delectable like eating the freshest fried chicken I&rsquo;ve ever eaten.</p><p>Peter stopped me a few times from hitting my father another time.</p><p>My half-sister was a source of bad memory, so my mind forgot her along with many other people and experiences. In 2020 or 2021, I began to see her sexually as a way to break away from reality and common sense—escapism. This was a very rare and intermittent feeling, but sometimes, I thought about her and masturbated several times. This was a contrast from the trauma associated with her, but at the same time, it was a concomitant result.</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard to say that that feeling has stopped, along with many other heightened negative thoughts and feelings associated with the experiences of the past.</p><p>I remember the feeling of playing tennis at the tennis court with my mother and my two younger brothers. Based on pictures, I think at one point JM and there were there playing tennis as well. I remember that JM&rsquo;s father, Simeon, played tennis.</p><p>I remember feeling a similarity between Joyner Lucas and Badjoy especially since Badjoy liked him.</p><p>I remember the hotel I and my classmates stayed at while we were attending National Student Convention. I remember the fanciness of the door and the card we had to use to open the doors. I remember staying in the shower too long because I was trying to understand how to use an Acne Wash that Aidan was unable to get his medal. Or maybe I was waiting for the Acne Wash to take effect or something.</p><p>I remember the sexual jokes Robyn, Aidan, and Andrei made. I think Juan Gutierrez and Neo Bregente hanged out in our room I think, joining in the sexual jokes. I think they were lying atop one another and hugging one another in a line.</p><p>I remember seeing or thinking about the court at the hotel.</p><p>I remember hearing that the boys were going to train there.</p><p>I remember the tickets or something for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, the delicious egg we ate at the hotel, and the usual strawberry and butter package I think.</p><p>I remember the somewhat fancy restaurant when I, my half-sister, my mother, John Joshua Ferrancol, and Anna stayed at a cottage for pictures with a client. I remember the older people who sat there and the feeling of going into the restroom. I remember the wind and the feeling of my jacket as I sat down.</p><p>I remember hanging out with Ate Krisha, a former youth from my original church, at a coffee place, probably Starbucks, in Tagaytag when we were erasing PACEs. She was there along with Ardy, Ate Danielle, and my mother.</p><p>I remember</p><p>If I had to recount the lives of those around me based on my perspective,</p><p>I think I remember having a reunion at a sports fest with Elaine Mae Duremdes Panela who was one of the two (or more) people who convinced me to sing in the Novaliches camp.</p><p>Reading books has been the most dehumanizing thing I&rsquo;ve ever done. I cannot help but feel that relying on these or even immersing myself and cutting off any sense of disbelief is doing a disservice to the life that they really lived. No book can capture the entire experience of the human mind.</p><p>From the pictures, when I went hiking with Ody, I was also with Kuya Arnold, Alyssa Mae Dulva, Ate something something, Adriana Fernandez, Dhan La Madrid, the mother of Dhan La Madrid, and Ate Lyn Subastil.</p><p>The initial feeling of touching the inside of a mostly bitten cucumber felt like touching wet Play-Doh clay.</p><p>I was diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder with Psychotic Features by Dr. Dane.</p><p>I remember listening to Daughters while on a bus going to Baguio I think with my mother. I was going to an event in Baguio where I would meet Ser Eman and Ate Priscilla and stay somewhere there for a few days to attend the event. Maybe it was another band like System of a Down.</p><p>I remember the feeling of staying up playing Breath of the Wild on the Switch console of Jeremiah until the morning in real life. I remember the sound of the rain and the colors of the morning in the game. I remember the monsters chasing after me on steeds, although I was also riding a steed, which was a horse.</p><p>I remember the sound of the rain as I stayed inside Jeremiah&rsquo;s room.</p><p>I think I remember having a dream about retweeting and or in Minecraft.</p><p>I think I remember having a dream about inputs in three levels or something.</p><p>I had a dream as of writing where I was with hundreds and hundreds of people, all of whom I believe were my classmates from MCA. I remember that it was only me and a few others, but somehow, it grew to hundreds and hundreds of people. Apparently, we were stuck in this place that I think looked like it was at my original church grounds but outside the chapel. There was this invisible barrier that prevented us from escaping, and it made a loud noise somewhat like electricity when one touched it. I remember when we were blinded somehow and then because we couldn&rsquo;t see, we just started accidentally bumping into one another. I think bumping into one another caused a loud noise, so it became very loud. We also kept bumping into one another because of this. I remember the feeling of just being trapped. I think I saw Ardy. I definitely saw this dude that was from MCA. I remember Jeilla I think. I remember seeing Kuya David. I remember that we were inside the chapel of my original church before the invisible barrier. I forgot if I was talking or listening to Jeilla or not. I think I remember JM as well.</p><p>I remember that in the dream, Ardy standing on the cement outside the chapel. I remember standing there too looking at her who was farther away. The dream was in first-person perspective.</p><p>I rememeber the &ldquo;palengke&rdquo;-looking place where I and David bought Garena shells for League of Legends and Crossfire Online too I think.</p><p>I will now remember why I know them and how I felt about them while interacting with them.</p><p>I remember Aya Rosales praying for me at the main church area of New Life Alabang. I think I was gathered at the front along with other youth to get prayed for. I remember other people praying for me as well. Cyrus (?) who was a singer prayed for me as well.</p><p>I remember when NCA went on a field trip where Jerry got a catfish somehow from a pond.</p><p>I remember a scene. It&rsquo;s either a dream, or it&rsquo;s a daydream. I remember a large mountain village. It felt like the village was in a place that was surrounded by high peaks. I remember that I met various people there. I remember it having to do with MCA or NCA maybe in terms of the people there. I remember the feeling of being in that village. I remember writing about it before, but I&rsquo;m not sure anymore where that piece of writing is if it exists.</p><p>I remember the feeling of waking up drenched with sweat. I remember lying down on the ground at the field of grass beyond Katarungan. I remember the feeling of just having a picnic there and taking my time. I remember Desiree being there and Ate Krisha.</p><p>I remember the several containers we brought full of rice.</p><p>I remember eating there and having an overall great time. This memory was, for a long time, replaced by newer memories of being there but with my former classmates at MCA.</p><p>I remember that we might have gone there with my former classmates from NCA too.</p><p>I remember eating icecream from an icecream vendor.</p><p>I remember hearing that we could wear casual clothes for the NCA Christmas Party 2012 and celebrating inwardly. I remember hearing Teacher Ingrid and Teacher Elijah announcing and scolding while we were standing in front of our tucked seats in the classroom inside the chapel.</p><p>I remember the entire class getting a lengthy hearing from Teacher Ingrid.</p><p>Teacher Noreen was less scarier to me than the other two, but she still scolded from time to time.</p><p>I remember the feeling of being outside because I had finished my PACE goals earlier. Sooner or later, I would get extra homework from Teacher Ingrid and see a note that read something like &ldquo;AP Pg. 10 - 15&rdquo;. &ldquo;AP&rdquo; stood for the tagalog term &ldquo;Araling Panlipunan,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Social Studies&rdquo; in English.</p><p>I remember the excitement of finishing the extra homework and get ahead of my classmates. I remember the feeling of just getting a star sticker which I then placed on the star chart. We had a goal chart and a star chart. Goal chart had the table containing the days of the week and the PACE subjects. Within the table, you would see &ldquo;10 - 15&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pg. 10 - 15&rdquo; or something. Sometimes, I remember seeing &ldquo;10 to 15,&rdquo; but it might have been a mistake.</p><p>I remember that Jared had lots of correction pens,and people would often ask and go to him for help I think.</p><p>I remember the messy desk of Clarence and his water jug and lunchbox.</p><p>I remember that two grade levels were combined, resulting in the classroom that had low desks and high desks. I remember the great feeling of upward social mobility when I was able to sit on the high desks finally.</p><p>I remember the feeling of sitting down beside Clarence and Jared I think.</p><p>We changed seats often due to students talking to neighboring desk mates too much.</p><p>I remember John Joshua&rsquo;s scolding expression toward his younger brother and looking somewhat secretive about that.</p><p>I remember the chatter during lunch break.
Those who tried to play basketball were scolded by Jerry, the security guard and handyman.</p><p>I remember the brown chairs aligned to the wall of Building A and Building B I think. The two, long, rectangular tables were probably absent and in a room. One table was red, and the other was yellow.</p><p>I remember a teacher crying once after scolding us in the classroom. It was either Teacher Ingrid or Teacher Elijah. It may have not been NCA because maybe it was that older female teacher from MCA.</p><p>Bridge to Terabithia. I remember watching this as a kid and feeling so sad that the kid was now gone. In fact, I think I remember not realizing the kid was gone or being in disbelief and having to ask my mother regarding the death. I think even Timothy cried.</p><p>I remember that our singing teacher for choir at MCA used the balloon metaphor for breathing exercises. I remember she mentioned needing to feel the breath at the back.</p><p>I remember the feeling of waking up drenched with sweat. I remember lying down on the ground at the field of grass beyond Katarungan. I remember the feeling of just having a picnic there and taking my time.

I think my hair was buzzcut at the time. It was in 2021 or 2022. I remember them being surprised and not recognizing me.</p><p>I remember playing with Badjoy at our old computer. I think he still lived in his older house at the apartment we used to live at. I remember playing Y8.</p><p>I probably played with JM too. I forgot the specific games we played, but I remember this game that had &ldquo;Zombie&rdquo; in its name or was about shooting zombies. The design, including the characters and the structures were blocky with round ends. The structures were just white cubes as a way to separate different sections of a certain map we opted to play in and fight the zombies. It was multiplayer with two players using the same keyboard I believe.</p><p>I remember how sharp the edge of the desk in 501D was. The desk was where we would stored various stuff in. The one that looked like a combination of different furniture. It supported the landline telephone, among many others.</p><p>I remember often lying down, smelling, and avoiding the dust of the books in the old, blue-painted bookshelf and the dust under the bookshelf.</p><p>I remember the long, long years of playing various Y8 games. I remember Kuya Paulo playing the flash games &ldquo;Sonny&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mud and Blood&rdquo;, and &ldquo;The Last Stand&rdquo;.</p><p>I remember playing Age of War.</p><p>Tasty Planet, a &ldquo;gray goo eats the world&rdquo; game.</p><p>Transcendence, the game about spaceships. Never really got into it.</p><p>Notrium, I loved the map editor, and playing the game felt immersive.</p><p>I still remember the older logos of Windows, and I would specifically name them and change their icon to make it feel more neat. I did that for a long time, and I don&rsquo;t know why. I only stopped after Windows updated I think, and I forgot to do it again.</p><p>I remember the feeling of the various guns in Crossfire Online. All of them were fun to use. I tried to log in again, but I think they deleted accounts in some merging between servers.</p><p>I remember this when I was playing, but I don&rsquo;t remember that they made it so that it was unneeded to repair weapons anymore:</p><p>&ldquo;Initially, after weapons are used in the game (Except in Mutation Mode), weapons will start to wear out and decrease accuracy; players can repair them by spending GP earned after each match. Heavily damaged weapons are often hard to control as the crosshairs will become very large, making aiming difficult, in addition to a high kickback that makes spraying hard to control. Damaged weapons, when sold, will earn less GP because the amount of GP needed to repair it will be deduced from the payout. Some special weapons from Reward Crates won&rsquo;t wear out, same as the event prizes given to players by publishers on occasion. Melee weapons never wear out though some may feature damage bar, they will always be at 100%. Later, this was changed so that no matter how long the weapons are used in the game, they will never wear out, thus players won&rsquo;t need to repair them after every match any more.&rdquo; - \href{https://crossfirefps.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons#Weapon_Categories}{CrossFire Fandom Wikipedia}</p><p>Many of these weapons I don&rsquo;t remember.</p><p>I remember playing Chicken Invaders 1, Chicken Invaders 2, Chicken Invaders 3, Chicken Invaders 4, and Chicken Invaders 5. I&rsquo;m not so sure about Chicken Invaders 5.</p><p>I remember the feeling that the Keyboard Smash games were high-tech for some reason at the time.</p><p>I remember a dream that I had where I was walking through a road. Around me were fields and fields of yellow. I remember that there were towers everywhere for a time. I remember children around me when I entered a town that was farther up the road. I remember a beam of light coming from the horizon, probably from a tall structure.</p><p>I forgot the other manifold details.</p><p>This part is probably from a book I wrote:
I remember that in the dream that I met twin children after knocking on a tower. I remember going up and meeting a man named Jacob. I remember talking about jobs with one of his sons, probably a different son from the twin children.</p><p>I remember the first time I smelled the aircon in this apartment. Just now, as of writing, after many, many years, I remember what it smelled like.</p><p>As of writing, the light flickered due to the movement of the curtain, and it felt like the sky was falling down on me for a moment. This was because I was compiling information and was watching old gameplay footage of the former facebook game &ldquo;Braaains&rdquo;. I also lacked sleep and needed to go to the bathroom.</p><p>A game that I think I&rsquo;ve seen before is &ldquo;Knight Online&rdquo;. I know my older siblings played it before, but I think the only thing I remember is the login screen and the art.</p><p>I remember this game about &ldquo;old mecha fighting colorful game&rdquo;.</p><p>I also remember Command& Conquer: Red Alert. I think the one I remember is Command& Conquer: Red Alert 1.</p><p>I remember playing on &ldquo;<a href=https://www.maxgames.com/%22>https://www.maxgames.com/"</a> and &ldquo;<a href=https://www.bubblebox.com/%22>https://www.bubblebox.com/"</a>, among others.</p><p>I remember playing the flash game &ldquo;Insectonator&rdquo; with Ate Danielle for some reason.</p><p>Now that I&rsquo;m looking through these flash games, I understand much better now that I had a life before 2009. I can visualize what I did and what I looked like, pairing certain images from the past with the concrete. Things in 2011 still seemed new to me, and I felt like I was much older than I was because I had experienced much already before 2011.</p><p>I had a long dream where Aidan and probably Andrei and Robyn had stayed with me in a place, a room, or something or four months. I think I remember my father being there as well but in another scene. I remember three scenes or things, including my father and Aidan. I forgot what the third one was that I was going to write, but I had to get water and refill. Overall, it was a long dream with multiple sequences.</p><p>When I was much younger, probably before 2008, I most likely played toys with my male siblings. Before that, I probably watched some TV but mostly played outside.</p><p>I had a dream where there was this person. He was this dude with glasses and was kind of a celebrity with his architecture. His buildings even had statues that looked like victorian maids or people in a ball.</p><p>I remember having a problem with him because I would</p><p>I remember being in a tatami room and going through the door would lead me to another point of my life. I was able to do that many times and see through many points of my life. This life was not my real life, but the life in my dream.</p><p>I remember that the people in those points of my life were in the past, but they could notice me for some reason.</p><p>I remember that I somehow caused a lot of bodies to explode.</p><p>I remember going to a store and seeing the architect celebrity. I had to avoid him around one particular item shelf, but then, one of his men noticed me. This black man had a gun, and he shot a black man who went in front of me trying to help. This person who saved me had glasses and a beanie and dreadlocks that kind of extended and drooped downward. I remember him just walking away because the man chasing after me shot him. He said that that man shot him and that he was dead, walking past the shooter and through the road. I remember the shooter still holding a gun and shooting another person. I was running, and it was in third person.</p><p>I remember tripping and falling against the cut-up body parts and the blood on the ground, falling unconscious beside some booth thing—probably a bathroom booth. Because of the blood, I was able to get out alive. I remember that I heard words that was basically narration saying something along the lines of &ldquo;Ironically, because of the body parts and the blood, he was able to survive. I remember that I was unconscious on the side of the car-filled road.</p><p>Afterwards, I started thinking that it would be better if I read the book rather than play the game or something. Maybe not play the game, but I did think that in the story. So maybe this whole dream was real, but then I registered it at that point when my &ldquo;character&rdquo; became unconscious that it was a game. I remember feeling that reading the &ldquo;story&rdquo; would be much easier because it&rsquo;s much more straight-forward with less tension.</p><p>I remember seeing Ardy in the &ldquo;certain points of my life&rdquo; when I was &ldquo;tatami-hopping&rdquo; or time traveling through tatami rooms through doors. I remember many, various people at those certain points of my life. I remember a very long dream full of me going through these tatami doors and seeing many, many people.</p><p>The part about me causing the body parts and the blood could have been something that actually happened in the dream or maybe it was a false memory in the dream. My heart wants to believe that it was a real part of the dream because the dream was actually entertaining in a thriller way.</p><p>In the dream, somehow, I could do these supernatural things, but I was also a killer. At the same time, some architect&rsquo;s bodyguard was chasing me. I remember that the architect disliked or hated me. I remember looking through what looked to be his facebook album and seeing many similar photos of this building. The building looked simple, but it had lights. Maybe, it was a nice building. It looked empty, but then the next pictures after around 10 - 15 pictures showed a close-up of the statues. The statues were, again, Victorian-looking with their dress and such. They were marble statues without color, and their eyes had no pupils. The lights around the building were purple I believe.</p><p>In the dream, because I fell unconscious with the blood and a body part, I was able to live, but the dream ended right before it showed me what transpired next.</p><p>I remember offending the architecture, but I forgot how it happened or what it looked like.</p><p>Logical inconsistensies persisted throughout the story such as the one where this dude was just shooting people on the street.</p><p>After I or my character fell unconscious, I saw many cars on the road, but this road was different from the one where that the shooter shot his first victim, that black dude with glasses and a beanie. The body parts and blood were placed on a small mound right beside the very short retaining walls of what looked like a sidewalk with dirt and probably a pitch-black silhouette of a tree. I remember that it was night time when I was at the store with the architecture all the way up to when I fell unconscious.</p><p>I remember that in the dream, I was also in a jeep probably. I think I remember Peter and someone else, probably John Joshua or his younger brother—who knows.</p><p>I think I remember acting in the dream for some reason because I just remembered acting so hard as in crying and shouting. Most likely, it came from a dream, so it was probably this dream.</p><p>I remember when Kuya Mike and Jeremiah casually mentioned that their mother, Tita Maris, was always out and about in a parentally neglectful way and always focusing on church. I remember sitting down or standing up at the table right past the backdoor gate entrance. This backdoor gate entrance is thin like a door.</p><p>I remember that for a period, many times, I&rsquo;ve heard the loud speaker music of the house with the mangoes located further up our house at the beginning and corner of another street running off our street&rsquo;s side perpendicularly. It also neighbored our street, as it was a corner lot.</p><p>I remembered making games because I thought they were fun but also because I wanted to play with my siblings. I made up the children&rsquo;s games we played at home as well. My time with them really developed my understanding of doing something for someone else—my empathy. Of course, my time with Sunday school and helping teach kids as a teacher&rsquo;s assistant was another crucial aspect of the development of my empathy.</p><p>My username (not my IGN OR in-game name) in Crossfire is &ldquo;flamethrower22&rdquo;, but I cannot get it back. I also cannot get back my Pointblank account since it exited from Garena.</p><p>The only reason why I&rsquo;m fine with growing up is because I want to learn. Even if my experiences in the past were manifold, I would still prefer to keep learning because the world is just that complex. My past experiences were complex, but the world is so much more byzantine than I could ever comprehend.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve started a small journey to document and list down as much media that I&rsquo;ve consumed in the past. This list will subdivided and included in my autobiography, so that I can move on toward new understandings without feeling like I&rsquo;m disregarding the complexities within the past.</p><p>I remember thinking when Peter grew his hair until it almost reached his shoulders that it was somewhat cute. I even commented that it would be fine if he kept it.</p><p>I learned about Hanukha watching Blue&rsquo;s Clues.</p><p>I had a dream. (July 22, 2023 6:30 PM as of writing)</p><p>In my dream, I remember seeing a boy who was angry and shooting people in a school I think.</p><p>I remember that the boy played a game where he felt that he could appreciate people.</p><p>I remember seeing many weird humans that looked like monsters i this game I think. I did see one with arms that were was askew in a wide saw tooth pattern. Even the nails were rectangular and slightly concave. This particular human monster looked like a zombie with greenish yellow or yellowish green skin. It had very cartoonist proportions in what seemed to be a realistic dream or a set-in-real-life dream, which made the monster stranger and out of place in my real life self&rsquo;s hindsight.</p><p>I remember the colors and texture of the school setting. They were dark-greenish and looked dirty and murky. It felt somewhat dark.</p><p>I remember this weird person who I was trying to contact. I remember going on Twitter and trying to search their name. I think they were a woman. I remember seeing their face peeking through and from behind a rectangular window set horizontally at the top of the wall next to the ceiling.</p><p>I remember seeing that I even liked a tweet if a person or something. The woman who visited me was part of a group of people who were also on Twitter.</p><p>I remember meeting them I believe.</p><p>I remember that I liked this woman in a platonic manner because she was nice.</p><p>The shooter and I were probably the same.</p><p>I remember that I probably had music or art that made the woman and her associates like me or something.</p><p>My telling of the dream is disjointed because the details are byzantine.</p><p>Regarding reality, I remember Peter playing that lumberjack game on Roblox where one cut wood, then dragged it to their truck, and drove off to sell it somewhere on a conveyor belt. I remember that the place or map of the game was large and having many trees of course.</p><p>I remember the Roblox game where I&rsquo;ve built spikes with the old and deprecated &ldquo;Build Mode&rdquo; of Roblox to defend against zombies.</p><p>It gets hard to remember and delineate my dreams since I wake up thirsty and needing to pee.</p><p>I usually remember them as long as I don&rsquo;t turn on the lights, go to the bathroom, or hear any kind of conversational noise.</p><p>I remember watching Wreck-It Ralph and feeling that it was new. That was 2012. Over 11 years ago as of writing. I still feel that newness when looking at thumbsnails of clips from the movie.</p><p>It&rsquo;s funny that my life felt so vivid, detailed, and yet so disjointed if you include all the details. I had so many manifold, distinct experiences that it feels so disjointed in hindsight. This is what inspires me to write a story full of changes and people coming and going away even if it feels disjointed. People who do stay change, and people who the main character meets again are whole different persons.</p><p>I remember playing the 3D mech action/fighting Dojin soft game created by Haruo Teshima, &ldquo;Silver Knights&rdquo;.</p><p>I remember playing the games Minesweeper and the Purple Place from Windows.</p><p>I remember listening to Korn loudly on my mother&rsquo;s VAOI laptop while she sat on the stairs behind the white-painted bars of the wooden railings. She had a forlorn, sad expression. I think she even cried. I was listening to Daddy by Korn at the time. I think this situation happened by accident, and I awkwardly just let the music play because I thought it would be more awkward if I turned it off just because my mother sat down to listen.</p><p>Link to my chat history with Chatgpt: <a href=https://www.yokseekan.goodepeople.com/chat.html>https://www.yokseekan.goodepeople.com/chat.html</a></p><p>I had a dream. (July 23, 2023, 9:47 AM as of writing)</p><p>The dream was about me being in Roblox. I remember someone asking if the people in the congregation could turn around. He said that the health bar or something prevented the ability for players to turn around, maybe because the health bar collides with the player.</p><p>I remember that while the person talked, I just closed my eyes and pretended to fall asleep probably in a humurous, sardonic way, my dream shifting between the dream and real life. I opened my eyes and woke up right after I felt that some hands were touching both sides of the front part of my neck.</p><p>The hand-touching feeling began to dissipate as soon as I comprehended that I was awake.</p><p>I think that in the dream, I was part of some other scene before the health bar one.</p><p>I had other long dreams, which occurred in the next sleep cycles and I forgot.</p><p>I remember attacking the crates in the RPG games &ldquo;Path of Exile&rdquo; and &ldquo;Titan Quest&rdquo;.</p><p>I remember the zombie creatures at the start of Path of Exile and the way they walked and moved around.</p><p>I remember playing &ldquo;Attack on Titan Tribute Game&rdquo;. I think I played this on multiplayer mode with David.</p><p>I remember using a &ldquo;Love Calculator&rdquo; flash game and putting a crush&rsquo;s name on it. It was probably Kelsey at the time.</p><p>I remember playing &ldquo;Broforce&rdquo; with Jeremiah. I think I remember playing it on his laptop or something rather than on the switch. Maybe at his old house, but most likely at his new house.</p><p>I had a dream. (July 24, 2023 11:30 PM as of writing) I remember getting frustrated.</p><p>I remember trying to build a structure in Minecraft but failing again and again.</p><p>I remember listening to Kuya Glenn announce the versions while mentioning that the popularity or usage of certain applications have declined. These included Minecraft. I remember hearing that Minecraft had two versions and that people were using it less. Kuya Glenn was announcing in front of an out-of-sight audience while probably appearing on a TV. I remember feeling that it was less like a news network and more like a local announcement channel.</p><p>I remember that in the dream, I tried to build one large structure in Minecraft. Instead, I accidentally built two structures overlapping each other. I remember a large gray wall made of the Minecraft material &ldquo;Stone.&rdquo; I remember the other structure being less horizontally slim like a wall and more horizontally stout or compact like a city building.</p><p>I remember looking at them from afar and growing frustrated as I somehow watched and listened to Kuya Glenn mentioning the new versions of certain applications.</p><p>I remember that in the dream, I saw a YouTube channel, which I thought belonged to my mother. I remember seeing 5 or 6 videos. One of these videos had a thumbnail showing the former pastor Sierra and probably certain people from my former main church. Maybe my mother was in the thumbnail. I remember that my mother told and gestured me to upload a video showcasing the world with the structure. A certain someone would evaluate it, and if they liked it, they would exchange it with something they had that I think I wanted. However, since I failed to make the structure well and instead made two structures, I believe the trade failed.</p><p>When I got frustrated in the dream, I remember growling. Interestingly, I remember having a false awakening, but for some reason, I knew that the room wherein I slept had only the orange lamps on, saving the computer screen that my brother Peter used. Maybe, I was half-awake, but I expressed my growl in the dream. I&rsquo;m sure it occurred in the dream rather than reality because my throat felt pristine.</p><p>My growl was emotional, during which, in the mind, I made various statements stemmed from motivation.</p><p>I remember that in the dream, the Minecraft world was very grassy, realistically so. I think I even remembered ponds that looked less blocky and more like real life. The only out-of-place objects in the place was the structures most likely due to their size, which meant that they could be realistic rather than cubed or blocky too, especially the wall. This meant that I registered the world as a Minecraft one in spite of all the factors that pointed to it being something else. Strangely enough, even if I was looking at the wall from afar, it felt like I got another angle looking at the ground along with the pond as well. Of course, the ability to ponder and imagine within the bounds of the dreams accounts for this second angle.</p><p>I remember that in the dream, the Youtube channel was in dark mode.</p><p>In a conversation with my father, he mentioned that the Minecraft server which included my father, me, and my younger sibling Peter at first occurred during a three-day period of my mother&rsquo;s absence from home. He noted that David and Kuya Paulo was mysteriously absent from the game, possibly absent from home as well. He said that the hotel, the finished product of which I remember, had a simple straight staircase design. He added that we derived the hotel design from an Internet article proposing an easy, efficient way to house the &ldquo;Villagers&rdquo; from Minecraft. He mentioned three games: Freelancer, &ldquo;Happylander,&rdquo; and Stronghold Crusaders, the demo of which we played predominantly. He stated that they called &ldquo;Happyland Adventure,&rdquo; which is the real name, &ldquo;Happylander&rdquo; was because I called it that.</p><p>I addressed the explosion, which a certain resident from Agro Homes Subd. caused inside the Minecraft server at a certain person&rsquo;s house. It could have been GB&rsquo;s or Aaron&rsquo;s, but I&rsquo;ve forgotten who came to the server later on. This perpertrator&rsquo;s father used to own the computer shop where we played often for a period of time.</p><p>My father confirmed that the explosion occurred later on in the server.</p><p>He said that the hotel spawned two golems.</p><p>I said that at least two golems spawned at the hotel.</p><p>My father said that he had accidentally bought two Skyrim games because he believed it had the multi-player feature.</p><p>I mentioned Knight Online, Flyff, Red Alert, and Age of Empires, of which I subsequently specified the first version.</p><p>My father said that Kuya Paulo was the only one who played Ragnarok online.</p><p>I remember when Ate and my mother talked with the former pastor Sierra in a discussion at the room in the chapel with the flimsy wall, while the Regional Director on board overlooked it.</p><p>I remember Ate recording it secretly with her phone in case they said something off.</p><p>I remember when Jared told me something along the lines of &ldquo;I feel like you&rsquo;re special and you&rsquo;re going to make it or become successful.&rdquo; We were walking home from MCA at the time at the farther side of the Katarungan or the Daang Hari road. I remember seeing Jared go up the staircase to the overbridge. I remember the various stall and people around. I remember this feeling of encompassing wonder and awe at the people around. In the end, that feeling resulted in me feeling like I wanted to hurry home to feel safe like the squirrel I&rsquo;ve been at that time. Jared&rsquo;s words hit me like a truck that time, but it grew even more impactful as time passed and during the current as-of-writing period post-MCA.</p><p>I remember when Jared got angry at me because I preferred to eat healthy food rather than street food. I remember when I rode along in Jared&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s vehicle on the way to school or, more likely, the way out. I remember the strange impression I got from the man on the wheel and the fact that the mother of Jared was sitting beside him. This man was someone else rather than Jared&rsquo;s husband. I think I heard from Jared that his father was out of the country, which made the impression that much more worrying. Of course, I was worried, but I believe this was before my mother cheated on my father. I remember the simple dhole-like face of Jared&rsquo;s sister, but besides that, she was nondescript at the time. A few occasions granted me a faint impression that she had more distinct characteristics, but at the moment, those feelings remain out of my comprehension.</p><p>I remember the face of Lei and the way she conversed with me and Elmo. I think I remember the mutually discordant interactions between Lei and Enzo alongside many others within the classroom. Tolerances were common, and I recognized that predominantly in the relationships between me and Paul. We were more than tolerant of each other; we were two different contrasting personalities trying to interact: an optimist and a pessimist, both of which were pristine and strong relative to the varying personalities within the classroom and to our age group.</p><p>I remember the overnight stay we had at Lauren&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s resort property. I remember feeling somewhat alienated due to the way the seniors treated the juniors.</p><p>It depended on how charismatic and sporty you appeared. The more physically outgoing you were, the more likely they&rsquo;d treat you as their own. My classmates were predominantly school-focused. The women, especially, were passionate about their volleyball. I remember even this one girl with glasses that I forgot who ran for a competition. It was John, the school&rsquo;s pastor and husband of the principal during my MCA era, that acted as a counterbalance to their drives for sports. He introduced and sharpened our understanding of the ritualistic with the mantras he indicated us to repeat and the fact he brought us to an anti–SOGIE Equality Bill demonstration. Seeing a political poster that displayed a person with the last name &ldquo;Hilapo,&rdquo; the same as John&rsquo;s, deepened my impression of a more orthodox &ldquo;church-state&rdquo; identity.</p><p>The MCA student identity was in sharp contrast, like a sharp, orchestral blade slicing a petty lamb, to my past life with my original church network and the various other people I&rsquo;ve met in close relationship with its members.</p><p>Yet, the MCA student identity lacked the extremism I witnessed and comprehended again and again during my Internet era that began 4 or 5 years ago, as of writing, after my MCA era.</p><p>Documenting my Internet era and everything I&rsquo;ve witnessed and learned in relative detail is too much for me right now.</p><p>One of my classmates at the time, Lei, gave me the impression of someone who focused on academics maybe at first. I think I remember learning that she struggled in academics, breaking that perception. I thought she was more of the type to hang out with Abi, Clara, Lauren, and Kyra, but it became more complex as Abi andCiarawere separate from Lauren and Kyra&rsquo;s group. Instead, Lei showed that she was willing to engage with more reserved, selective students like Elmo, Jared (I think), and me. I remember the way Lei sat down and conversed with us. I think I remember her getting a chair and sitting down next to Elmo. For the most part, she would just stand up and talk next to us, sometimes leaning on our desks. She moved like she was strict with herself, but I think it was only an impression. I have heard her get annoyed many times, but it was usually in good humor.</p><p>Aidan, many times, was hard to like. His behavior showed much of that notorious, persistent happy-go-lucky behavior that only people who got everything they wanted and needed had. The fact that he was good at studying, handwriting, and sports made him feel like he was going to be the one holding the reins of the classroom. Of course, in the end, this was a weak impression I had.</p><p>Andrei&rsquo;s most defining characteristic was the class clown act he adopted and the way he broached serious topics when he relaxed that act. I remember the way he sounded and the strange noises he made when he joked around.</p><p>At the start of the school year, Paul felt like he was happy finally to get Aidan and Andrei in the same classroom as him. It was because Aidan and Andrei were a grade below him and because this classroom provided an interjoined means for grade 7 and 8 to interact. I remember the giddy way Paul moved when he was with them or just after interacting with them. This accounted for the tensive way he behaved after the students in the classroom voted me to be the president instead of him.</p><p>After I quit school, I was able to confirm Andrei&rsquo;s struggle in handling serious topics that required charisma beyond joking and humor. This was after I invited them to an event that New Life Church held for the youth.</p><p>I remember talking to Andrei in text because I think I remember him wanting to engage with me more. However, as a teenager, Andrei had his own concerns that he&rsquo;s rather pursue and struggled to discuss with me anything that would bear much fruit in terms of fulfilling teenage dreams. This showed that his seriousness could only extend as far as his ability.</p><p>Aidan was more capable of handling serious matters, but I was impossible to dissect and hard to interview. I struggled with communicating myself and had too many issues that an interview would fail to fix. Even having a therapy session that lasted months struggled to put a dent to the struggles I had. It was only after a years of severly painful self-improvement filled with numerous mental breakdowns and burnout that I finally achieved a working pace.</p><p>Once, Paul made me cry after the mocking, challenging way he behaved toward me. Nowadays, I see this behavior as something to be expected in the Internet, but growing up only showed me the good, accepting side of the world, which gave me that pristine strong optimism I had during my MCA era that influenced and inspired my classmates enough to vote me as the classroom president.</p><p>My father was one good example of someone who had a very strong influence in teaching me mocking, challenging behavior and using the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just joking&rdquo; or &ldquo;they&rsquo;re just teasing&rdquo; method to get away with it despite his repeatedly proclaimed victimhood from familial perpetrators using said method. He treated me with little empathy, only crying for himself. When he rarely said &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; it was after a rage episode of him indicating that it was our faults rather than him. It was the kind of &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; that made me stare outside in self-suppression and silence after all the volatile arguments I had with him. I was the one who wanted to please and obey the rules the most because I grew up in an accepting community wherein the rules felt like love taps rather than the devil&rsquo;s devices. I was the most strict with myself, which made me attempt suicide two times due to my failure of making my father happy. Since I was young, my earliest memory had always been him shouting at me, hitting me with a belt, and me coming up to his dark room to apologize to him for being disrespectful. My desire to please him increased the more he hit and shouted at me, and the accepting community I was in taught me about the Bible and its laws, loving God, and &ldquo;doing the right thing even when no one was looking.&rdquo; Learning that hypocrites existed was one of many doors that allowed me to see through a more holistic view of the world surrounding me. It was through knowledge that I gained the insight to realize that the only thing I must do is move forward and keep learning because it might just change everything again just like the many times I learned that the father and mother or authority figures I had betrayed my understanding of their goodness. I blamed myself for 8 years (8 was a random number that I had selected, but it ocurred generally for &ldquo;many years.&rdquo;) only to realize that I was a human being with all its implications and meanings.</p><p>Delineating what I believe a human being is poses a complex challenge.</p><p>The same way I repeatedly say certain words as a way to express certain ideas and emotions while ensuring that I am the only one capable of comprehension, the same way I also say &ldquo;human being&rdquo; with my manifold understanding and uses of it. I predict that in order to explain this byzantine understanding, I will have to write an autobiography spanning past a million words, &ldquo;master&rdquo; digital art, and master fingerstyle guitar, piano, and violin, read hundreds of textbooks, among tens of others. Explaining it fully justifiably is impossible due to the fact that I cannot convey my memories and the infinite number of factors that implicate my comprehension, including the simple but profound five senses.</p><p>Of course, every other human shares this extreme-level complexity of understanding.</p><p>If I had to describe my life metaphorically, I think I began falling from when I was born. I&rsquo;m falling off a cliff, and at the bottom is my death. In the journey of life, I meet many people who join me in my fall. I sometimes feel depressed, sad, bored, angry, and happy, and when people leave, it might sting. I can imagine hundreds of people falling in the distance. We&rsquo;re all falling to our doom, but it seems we&rsquo;re making the most of our lives. Some have small goals, and some ponder about the grander goals, knowing they can achieve the small goals they had thought were difficult before accomplishing them.</p><p>That can be described as oversimplistic and disrespectful to the complexities of life, but when life gets too hard, these are the narratives I and many others consume, sometimes to humanity&rsquo;s benefit, sometimes to humanity&rsquo;s decline and pain.</p><p>Cynicism is one such oversimplistic ideal that only yields further suffering, but it is a <strong>natural</strong> part of the <strong>abnormal</strong> tensions that humanity and society, whether that of one person, that of ten people, or that of a billion, goes through.</p><p>This metaphor and these statements are reflections of my humanity, philosophy, or belief system.</p><p>I remember Kuya Paulo showing David a knife and showing him that he can cut himself or something to prove a point. I remember Kuya Paulo scaring David because he hated that David swore.</p><p>I remember seeing Kuya Paulo have self-harm marks on his wrist, which made me realize that I never discovered him doing it. I remember seeing him click away because he was watching a video series where people have sex in bed or something. I failed to find it.</p><p>I remember the various outdoor games I played with Timothy and Peter:</p><p>I remember the various outdoor games I played with people: cops and robbers, Patintero, Tumbang preso, Tumbang preso but with shoes instead of slippers, the floor is lava, Truth or Dare, Blind Man&rsquo;s Bluff, Simon Says, Red Light, Green Light, Tag/Chase, Hide and Seek, The floor is lava, I spy, Marbles, Red Rover, Human knot, T-shirt relay, Heads up, seven up, Jacks, Silent ball, a variation of Ringolevio, Dodgeball, Marco Polo, Hot potato, Freeze tag, Zombie tag (different name in the Philippines), Flashlight tag (maybe), Laser tag, Langit-lupa, Chinese garter, Hand clapping games, Luksong-baka (leapfrog), Patay patayan (Guess the killer), Piko, Trompo</p><p>T-shirt relay is a children&rsquo;s game where we try to bring a certain shirt (not our clothes) around our arms, torsos, and heads passing it through our held hands until we reached the other end of the hand-holding line.</p><p>I remember playing a children&rsquo;s game where we would imitate the ragdolls in video games specifically when a character dies.</p><p>I remember playing a children&rsquo;s game where we would shout as loud as we could in front of someone and whoever shouted the loudest won.</p><p>I remember where we had to find a specific verse in the Bible as soon as the verse was revealed. The first person to find the verse and reads it out loud wins.</p><p>I had a long set of dreams as of writing (7/27/2023) that I forgot. I was too lethargic to write it down.</p><p>I could&rsquo;ve died when I watched that show (any show, any random show that immersed me), and I would be fine. I have wondered many times recently why I have lived this long. It felt like I could&rsquo;ve died a long time ago, and it would have been alright. I feel that I have lived hundreds and hundreds of lives, only to live past each one somehow. Fictional shows are just one of many, which scares me how much more immersive and life-changing my real life experiences have been. I have lived too long I think, but at the same time, I&rsquo;m curious as to what I would learn from here on and what will happen to me.</p><p>I remember Ardy sitting on my lap in a car because it was too full. I remember we were going somewhere and were going home from somewhere. I remember it because I felt awkward and I could guess that it felt awkward for Ardy as well.</p><p>I remember the various faces in United Hills Church when I went to an event there. I reciprocated when a girl with black hair and a black shirt communicated their curiosity to me via the means of staring.</p><p>I remember the tall people who walked about when I was younger. I remember thinking Ate Danielle felt taller than the towers above. Now, I&rsquo;m taller than her.</p><p>I remember talking to Jeremiah regarding what we were going to eat. I remember eating pizza after Jeremiah called the pizza service on his phone. I remember getting a partial glimpse of the pizza deliver guy at the doorstep past the bushes and the pillar holding up the garage attachment set in front of the house.</p><p>I remember the feeling of having to close the door of Jeremiah&rsquo;s room because his older brother Michael would get angry I think.</p><p>I remember the sound of my footsteps on the floor. I remember that the flooring was either ceramic tiles or porcelain tiles. I remember the marble countertop. I remember the somewhat ornate, solid-wood chairs at the dining table. I remember the glass top of the table. I remember the fancy small chair with a drawer attached to it at the entrance room area.</p><p>The new house of Jeremiah was much smaller than the mansion-like house where he used to live, so the various parts of the new house were hardly separate.</p><p>I find that the hilarious part of Jeremiah, along with Lauren, is that they would avoid the use of identifiers that depict them as wealthy, but it is true that they have much more significant wealth than especially my close associates for much of my life.</p><p>This statement is a little ambiguous and strange, but I will include it because it reflects my pre-defined logical thinking: &ldquo;Even so, I am richer than these associates of mine because I am middle class. Yet, Jeremiah and Lauren seem to far exceed I and my family&rsquo;s means. If we&rsquo;re speaking of willpower, philosophical power, confidence, and skill in handling matters that take place in the predominant realm, then my mother especially might have an advantage.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember watching the tall bright light at this certain place, somewhere near the mall where I came with MCA on a grade-specific field trip probably.</p><p>I remember having to &ldquo;do devotions,&rdquo; wherein I would find a verse in the Bible and write it down. I would also write down various characteristics of it such as &ldquo;Application,&rdquo; or how to apply it, among others.</p><p>It is highly likely that I wrote down various thoughts and ideas on my school notebook in NCA and MCA. It is likely that I doodled as well.</p><p>I remember reading various classic books such as &ldquo;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&rdquo; by Mark Twain, &ldquo;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&rdquo; by Mark Twain, and &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe&rdquo; by Daniel Defoe.</p><p>I remember struggling to read a book about an old captain, probably set in the pirate age due to its highly stylistic writing, specifically using eye dialect (e.g., &ldquo;G&rsquo;day mate, &lsquo;ow ya doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;).</p><p>I think that in the past, I would quickly shut any college-level textbooks as soon as I read the first page. Having &ldquo;ChatGPT&rdquo; allows me now to ask speedily for both holistic and analytical definitions of various scientific, mathematical, and medical terms, which can take a while but makes learning effective. Of course, compared to searching the dictionary, this &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo;–aided process is much more streamlined.</p><p>I remember the feeling of waiting behind a bar fence for a chance to ride at an amusement park or amusement center. I remember the younger faces of various former youth members from my former main church, or original church.</p><p>I remember seeing pamphlets for the first time. I did this first before I finally picked them up at another occasion. I associated them with wealth and elegance. It was only a regular paper pamphlet, but such a pamphlet was disconnected from the kinds of presentational materials with which I came into contact in my environment. I grew up in an environment largely surrounded by a dirt and pollution, a much more poorer one compared to notoriously trashy New York. Yet, this environment was my home, and I identified with it over the alien urban planning of incredibly spacious and super neatly subdivided affluent neighborhoods. When I did encounter a pamphlet of relatively above-average quality rather than poor quality, you can imagine how I held and inspected it as if it was a rare gem that adults liked to talk about.</p><p>I remember the feeling of going outside on the streets and seeing the street lights around. I would often stare at the shadows produced by them. I remember feeling discomfort due to the occasional intermittent flashing of lights every time it passed through the car window while I tried to rest or sleep inside the car.</p><p>I remember when we ate rice with weevils for a while. It&rsquo;s still weird to me, and that strange feeling lingers in my mnemonic tongue.</p><p>\section*{\centering I. \textit{OVERTURE}}
A young person thus is defined by the precepts he commands willingly. He pursues demands and fulfills demands. He causes the world to turn albeit slowly (glacially). He wishes and compounds upon himself the worth of the world—thus defined by those who wish for a meaningful existence. Philosophers and such are these people.</p><p>Perfection is but a fleeting glance when gazing upon the complexity of the human.</p><p>Shutting off all the lights of the mind to entertain dreams and the abstract causes the man to decide whether the abstract (and the emotional) defines his life or the realistic (and the logical). In truth, both the emotional and the logical stem from the same brain, carrying with it the definition of life that precedes values, strengths, and weaknesses.</p><p>Bridled with soul, the human is an abstract creature, the brain of which continuously collates and collects vials of thought and seeks out those words that define his existence, albeit inaccurately. The biding human is a senseless one, full of the nonsensical delusions found in the psychotic, but the human that decides feels nature and the cores of souls, as evidenced by the willingness of human to understand beyond himself and within himself (of which he struggles in comprehension).</p><p>The exchange of ideas is thus furthered by the difficulty of the shifting of belief systems in the growing man. When a young man replaces his elders, he becomes the agency rather than the agent. He becomes the inquisitor rather than the questioned. It is here that a young person understands the difficulties of a stuck mind in a flourishing, byzantine interplay of dynamics within a greatly complex world.</p><p>\section*{\centering II. \textit{VOLATILITY}}
I wonder if suppression has always been a benefit because to express via alternative means rather than talking is to express suppressed emotions.
Singing, dancing, drawing, writing, and all manner of communication allows me to express while avoiding a side, a decision, and a specific, identifiable argument.
Yet, even now, my thoughts are being analyzed. My voice is fallibly monotone. My intentions are misconstrued. My ideas are propounded in order to facilitate miscommunication and misunderstanding. Even now, the voice that I have is called to violent imaginations, not of mine but that of pretentiousness and wickedness.
Even now, the words that I speak are arbitrary and abstract because they are made to be so. The meaning is thus lost in translation for the mind is mnemonically translating in order to deceive itself and to facilitate self-confirmation (or confirmation bias). Thus, my ideas will forever be missed and under an idealogical basis rather than a logical, objectively considered statement (if that may apply to anyone within contact range).
In the end, I am an abstract idea rather than a human being. In my eyes, I am a human being capable of mismanagement and proper management of ideas and emotional reactions. But to a fallible mind, I am incapable of that, only to be simplified to a symbol of repression or misused authority and power. Thus, I will continue on with fortitude knowing that I am forever elusive to those who yearn to dismantle my hopes and dreams because I fail to match my understanding with the reality of myself as my eyes are fallible and abstract too.</p><p>I propound this idea that the human mind carries an incorrigible complexity that withstands the analyses of those who seek to identify it in its entirety.</p><p>I remember when I went outside and saw the rain at my old house as of writing. I remember the sound of the rain and the way it hit the cement wall in front of the entrance of this house. I remember the passing faces, possibly that of Kelsey and her family, next to this wall. I remember the brown and desert-yellow Keeshond dog of our neighbor&rsquo;s family and their faces which I had forgotten and now seem like gray molds. I remember that Kelsey&rsquo;s and Badjoy&rsquo;s family lived on the second floor while I and my family lived on the first floor. I remember that other people whom my mother knew at the time lived on the third floor. I had forgotten them as well.</p><p>I remember the Chinese-looking person at the store in front of our house across the road. She owned a shop and even had children. I remember that I and my male siblings would buy the cheapest snacks from her. I remember especially buying the chocolate brand &ldquo;Choc Nut.&rdquo;</p><p>I think I remember that this Chinese person was pregnant at one point.</p><p>I remember playing card games with former church friends and relatives on my mother and Jeremiah&rsquo;s side many times. &ldquo;As of writing, we currently have many items that give the impression of a varied recreational life, including tennis rackets, water guns, card games, and board games such as chess, &ldquo;Monopoly,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Game of the Generals.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember when I reacted violently to a older stranger cat that I thought was a paedophile. He was most likely playing with a kitten, but the older cat was adopting a very dominant position that I assumed to be sexual in nature. The kitten also sounded frantic when it meowed. However, when I searched up just now as of writing regarding paedophilia in cats and even animals, I learned that humans had a different sexual biological compared to animals, which made me feel ashamed for reacting so strongly before.</p><p>I had a dream (July 27, 2023 12:17 PM as of writing) where I was hanging upside down though a bungee-like rope from an overhanging bridge maybe. I think I remember a kid there below on the ground. I remember somehow going from that to looking at robots attacking one another from a top-down view. The robots looked 2D to me. I remember that one of the robots, the one on the right, attacked the one on the left with an extension, an arm of some sort with a curving, rectangular shaped like a gun mag. This arm slammed into the other robot with sparks I think. The setting of the place was in a cave-like place with deep black or mostly black and slightly bluish walls.</p><p>I had another dream where my sister was standing outside past a large grided window. It might have curved outwards. I remember that she held up a device of some sort that let out a strong, pulsing beep. It checked for fire by checking for invisible smoke somehow. She was probably inside an enclosed space, maybe a tent. I remember that I was in my room somehow, so that meant the gridded window somehow replaced where my window and bathroom would be in real life and then conveniently lost precedence in my view. I remember that in the dream, my father checked me and learned I was sleeping. I pretended to sleep and could somehow either see him or imagine him in the dream. I remember that he returned only to somehow enter through the door and peek at me from the top of a thin, wide board in front of me closer to the window and bathroom. This board seemed analagous to Japanese paper walls, but it was thicker and looked like solid wood. It looked probably black or mostly black. I remember that when my father entered the first time, somehow, I could feel myself &ldquo;right-clicking&rdquo; the door as if with a mouse, and I saw a pop-up window, the one seen in Windows computers, and it read something along the lines of &ldquo;Kids&rsquo; Room; Leave.&rdquo; It is highly likely that it did have a semi colon. It could have been my father who right-clicked the door rather than me because I was pretending to be asleep. Though, again, it is strange because I could see my father looking at me from behind the door the first time evenwhen I was pretending to be asleep, which involved the shutting of the eyes. I remember hearing my sister and probably my male siblings talking in the background even if they were out of sight. I remember hearing them talk about me or about the Punisher maybe. I remember that when my sister held up the device for detecting fire, she was doing it because she expected me to do something that somehow caused a fire. It&rsquo;s strange because I remember only lying down in my room, but maybe I was doing something else. I remember that when my father went to check me and learned that I was &ldquo;sleeping,&rdquo; he reported this to my male siblings downstairs.</p><p>The next dream was about the Punisher. I remember believing that the Punisher&rsquo;s backstory went in a certain way different from the actual one. I remember seeing through an invisible camera at the back or behind a car. This car was located on the side of the road. It was parked, facing the road in a 45-degree manner. I remember a wall in front of it at the right side. This wall seemed to be both far away (several meters away) and right next to the car at the same time. I remember seeing a mother, a grandmother, and a child. I was looking at their seats from behind, which had head rests. I just knee from the partial view I got of their shoulders, hair, and heads. I think I remember the car having three rows of seats. The one at the front was where the grandmother was. The one in the middle was where the child, who was probably a teenager from the sound of his voice, and the mother sat.</p><p>I remember thinking that the grandmother was the mother at first maybe from how young she looked. She might have looked older after I began thinking her to be the grandmother, which occurred while she was outside and in front of the car. She left maybe to the mall across the street or road.</p><p>I remember the child or teenager calling the mother &ldquo;Mom&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; which either confirmed or convinced me that the person seated to the right of the boy was the mother.</p><p>I remember awaiting the climax of the backstory of the Punisher, who was apparently the child or teenager at the time. I think that earlier I heard or saw a flash far off in the distance a long way behind a protruding part of the wall in front of the car and at the right side of my view. I remember that a dude who had dark skin and hair with a faded blonde color emerged in front of the car. I remember somehow iterating to myself what the plan of this dude, who would be the killer of the mother. He was either saying the plan out loud or had said it earlier before coming here. The man&rsquo;s mouth was open, but it was still from what I remember. I remember him wearing a simple t-shirt. The man&rsquo;s backstory was somehow regarding the death of his son or wife or something and he was giving up to attack a random citizen. I remember him saying that he was going to take on a fake Black person&rsquo;s name even. Right before the murder occurred, I woke up.</p><p>Because I go through the internet a lot wherein a lot of media reside, it&rsquo;s most likely because of constant stimulation and the naturally strange nature of dreams that this set of dreams are this surreal rather than having any specific meaning, Furthermore, when I woke up, I registered it as sensual stimulation, surreal in itself, rather than feeling worried or scared regarding what it meant. Documenting dreams such as this might give me some ideas in the future. It is important to note that they&rsquo;re my dreams rather than the product of someone else, so I can easily identify with them more.</p><p>I remember when I and my male siblings had to take turns using the computer. I remember feeling that playing two hours on the computer was incredibly fortunate. Any more than two hours felt like a cheat. It was around this time that our older computer was put away because it stopped working maybe or maybe we replaced it with another computer and monitor. Maybe our parents thought that having two computers for too long was excessive; we did have two computers at one point in the past. Of course, later on, we now have several laptops and two desktop computers that are much faster than before. We experienced social mobility. I still struggle to edit videos with this computer while also searching and downloading images and videos to use (with fair use) for creating edited video essays.</p><p>I remember the joyful feeling of doing devotions. It was so satisfying doing devotions because writing in itself was a pleasant activity especially when finishing my devotions meant that I would be able to use the computer and create and code Roblox games. I was an active participant in bot the outdoors and indoors lifestyles, much more so compared to my younger brothers.</p><p>I remember the rare, cold feeling of waking up at night as a young teenager only to be greeted by the darkness. I was afraid of the dark as a child, and what I would do, which I&rsquo;m sure many people have done, was pretend to be lots of things. I pretended to be a psychopath and to be an evil person because that made me feel intimidating and threatening. I thought that if there indeed was a ghost, if I could at least scare them, that would be splendid. When I grew up, finding out that more horrific things existed in the world, I grew numb to violence and the darkness. Surprisingly, I still struggle with past memories relating to people due to some order of trauma, which I found to be involved in anxiety and trembling. Regarding growing numb to violence, I like to believe that the alignment between my reading of medical textbooks and my growing up with exposure to many good things—good, varied people, experiences, failures, goals, and successes, among others—enabled me even to look at images showing real-life gore on the Internet. I would rather take pride in empathy and emotional sensitivity though rather than pro-war or overly aggressive attitudes, so when I mention gore, I say that hoping that I can at least use this for good.</p><p>I remember the feeling of reading the webnovel &ldquo;Everybody Loves Large Chests&rdquo; by Exterminatus or Neven Iliev. For some reason, it captivated me, setting it apart from the other novels of which I read the premises or beginning chapters. The story is quite long, so trying to remember my opinions of every part of the story from the past will take a while.</p><p>I remember the feeling of reading the manwha &ldquo;Distant Sky&rdquo; before it was finished. It was the most immersive manwha I have read at that point of time. I still remember the feeling until now—that maybe cold, dark space, wherein all that trash resided, in the story. I can still feel the various storylines that only seemed to be nonsensical, but if I could guess, I tended to write nonsensical, surreal stories, but of course, my stories were much less developed and harder to understand. Distant Sky was much more clearer, but for most people, it lacked a plot, but for me, it was a good way to spend my time. Now that I look at it, its length was much shorter than other stories on Webtoon, but it did feel like years had passed. That&rsquo;s how immersed I was in the story.</p><p>Saying that it was bad is hard even after I&rsquo;ve grown up. It was formative to my understanding of fictional worlds, just as much as many other books, manwha, and comics, among others.</p><p>I have taken full size screeshots, using one of the applications in Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;Inspect Element,&rdquo; of my discussions on the Incredibots forum, my praising message to Exterminatus and his thankful reply, and my Roblox develop page wherein my games from years past resided, among others.</p><p>I also archived my old Youtube channel by the name &ldquo;SamyUi&rdquo; on Internet Archive&rsquo;s Wayback Machine. I have the link to this on my email.</p><p>I remember reading Albert Camus&rsquo; &ldquo;The Stranger&rdquo; and it having subdued but relatively useful impact on me. I have read too many novels regarding the obscene and the absurd, especially pertaining to murder and warfare, so the impact of this novel was reduced in me.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve read, watched, and looked too much on fiction from all kinds of different genres that I have grown jaded and now prefer non-fiction advanced textbooks over them.</p><p>I remember playing the classic 2003 game &ldquo;Notrium&rdquo; by the game developer &ldquo;Instant Kingdom&rdquo; feverishly. I failed to win the game myself even after playing it for a while. Within the game, I remember the feeling of staring out in the cold air and seeing the vast array of alien creatures headed toward me, their footsteps like an impending clock to doom. I remember the collections of items littered on the ground and the way the walls were shaped gave me a feeling of abstractness that prevented me from fully immersing myself on a street view angle. I remember the the grass wherein I hid, believing that it would cloak me from the beasts in the night, but I was wrong again and again even after I kept trying. I remember the strange turrets that shot at me and made me walk away as soon as possible. Since the game lacked a sprint function, I was left to walk as if casually and coldly toward my own bloody doom. When I did die, a surreally made 2D image possibly created in a 3D environment greeted me. It made the idea of death in the game much more avoidable, as I preferred the feeling of having a turret myself even if it would take a while. I spent effort, gathering random items and tools, most of which were useless to my respective goal in each round I did. When I did make something of worth, I would see the inventory opening after I humbly pressed the &ldquo;I&rdquo; key on my keyboard, thinking myself a creative individual due to the corroborative way the developer set the alignment of the slots and the art style pertaining to the inventory. I remember the feeling of the grains of rock or sand on the ground, taking one step one after another as if waiting for the &ldquo;mini-map&rdquo; to tell me I have made it even if I was ignorant regarding how to proceed. When I entered a dangerous zone beyond what I could handle, I was distraught, finding myself easily slain under the attacks of the alien beasts. The alien but friendly impression of this mint-colored zone was a lie. I would die many more times in this same area. Every death would lead me to begin again at the spaceship where I then crashed on the planet where the game was set, arriving in a small, enclosed shack of some sort. I remember an &ldquo;NPC&rdquo; standing there, whom I could make to follow me if I did something special. This was among the many experiences I had in Notrium, a good game. After playing it again, I remembered several things: the constancy of bullets, &ldquo;electric plants,&rdquo; and &ldquo;edible fungus&rdquo; in the form of a rectangular sprites on the ground.</p><p>Yet, this 438-word description was brief relative to the actual amount of experiences I had in this game and, even more so, relative to every other experience I had with other games, stories, and real-life experiences, among others.</p><p>The rain was a constant immersive element in my life, but hearing the talk of several people was even more so constant and immersive. Having these two elements in the background at the same time contributed to a day filled with awe and wonder, whatever it may be that preoccupied my mind—good or bad, ecstatic or terrifying.</p><p>I remember feeling only awe, curiosity, and patience despite the many, long walks and hours of listening to people talk with my mother at the many places where we sojourned throughout my childhood and younger adolescence. I was simply outgoing and someone who liked to listen even if I was a simple talker whom my mother introduced several times as shy. I would often write down what people said and go along with people whatever we did, which recently felt like a natural reaction to the positive experiences I had.</p><p>Of course, it was only when I had a notebook and when I was in a Christian service that I wrote down anything.</p><p>The flash games that I played usually were characterized by nonlinear gameplay.</p><p>It looks like I&rsquo;m only one of many data hoarders or archivers on the Internet. Some have already placed every single &ldquo;Royalroad&rdquo; (the webnovel website) chapter of &ldquo;Everybody Loves Large Chests&rdquo; on Internet Archive&rsquo;s Wayback Machine</p><p>I finally have the file of the 2003 version of the classic game I played: &ldquo;supertux-0.1.1-setup.exe&rdquo;.</p><p>Returning to the &ldquo;level editor&rdquo; of this version is like returning to an ugly, old shack full of dirt and muck, but the only thing you remember is the feeling of happily playing in it, ignorant of how much better things would become.</p><p>I notice a pattern among two classic games I&rsquo;ve played and enjoyed: the versions I played were both made in 2003.</p><p>List of games installed on my mother&rsquo;s phone based on recently added (oldest to newest):</p><p>The specific installment of the video game series &ldquo;Age of Empires&rdquo; that I played was &ldquo;Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings,&rdquo; which was apparently released on September 30, 1999.</p><p>I think I remember the gratifying feeling of not going to school during my NCA days. It was so nice to be able to stay at home and just play video games. I think I remember that rarely, my mother would let me stay at home even if I was healthy.</p><p>In a conversation with my mother, she mentioned that Ate Michelle, an older cousin of mine, laughed when I said that I disliked popcorn.</p><p>I think I used to watch my Kuya Paulo play Alien Shooter or something similar, but in a conversation with my father, he said that he didn&rsquo;t remember, only leaving me with Notrium as the &ldquo;shooter, full of gore&rdquo; that I asked from him.</p><p>Regarding spacious city residential areas, I have been to many such places, namely in locations such as Makati and Mandaluyong.</p><p>I remember the way that I jumped during concerts or energetic praise and worships in church network events and such. I prodominantly jumped up and down. When I was next to Badjoy, we would jump together, leaning onto one another. I remember Coach Ryan who could jump really high due to being very athletic and relatively tall. He would jump as well during these energetic moments.</p><p>I remember the variegated designs put onto the multiplicity of churches where I&rsquo;ve been. I remember the architectural flavor each chapel brought to my comprehension.</p><p>I remember that in this certain church (New Life Church), the way each hallway subserved the multifarious human interlocutions, which occurred on sequentially multicultural pluralistic tandems that corroborated mnemonic nodes seamlessly into an interconnected unit, the circuitry of which shifting rapidly comparable to a spinning &ldquo;trompo&rdquo; within the church setting. At this time, as exemplified by those present, the human mind subsumed every constituent part of those who registered their presences inside as distributors or so-called &ldquo;hand-shakers,&rdquo; and even those who spent their time hiding at the deepest parts of their brain &ldquo;asleep.&rdquo; This subsuming of ideas can be described as an allocative series of rolls and turns, almost dangerously spiraling but not quite, as it perfuses communicative responses with collaborative mnemonic power through the dissemination of emotional and logical registrations along with the senses that guide our differential experiential life-long systems and the communication of information through the kinesthetic, lingual, and visual-manual modalities or systems especially resulting in the enjoining against the deprivations erect from our behavioral characteristics, and thereby returning unto the benefactors that resultant convenience of motivation and growth. This complexity of human experience is thus shared across the many churches, each of which is a distinct instructive hub and which I&rsquo;ve experienced throughout my life, yet effectuating greater differentiation and contradistinction of percepts along integrative processes. Each hallway demonstrated that the human&rsquo;s connections and roles satisfy the seemingly incongruous definitions for both their current presence and previous formative social-psychophysiological identities throughout their developmental history.</p><p>In short order, I have communicated the heart of these experiences, which I believe those whom were present also epistemically have observed but dismissed it rather than having its content reified via substantiative recital. Nevertheless, the word choice falls short of grasping those associations&rsquo; vast properties completely. Despite the already established difficulty of analyzing animals&rsquo; behaviors, what&rsquo;s more, the human, who is thoroughly focused in anthropology, which has been called &ldquo;the science of humanity,&rdquo; still is bereft of much of the documentation they deserve.</p><p>One sentence that I left here while I was structuring my thoughts:</p><p>&ldquo;Even one hallway can alter the compensatory behaviors whose the as with the the next.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember what it felt like to see JM come visit after I purposely put my face against the mud in front of our neighbor&rsquo;s house right at the corner outside. That past moment plays a particular part in affecting how I respond to my emotional reactions, specifically those of a sense of betrayal, because that past moment demonstrated my capacity, albeit limited, for seeking attention. I fear that my father believes that I am an attention seeker rather than an normal well-intentioned confused individual struggling with a sense of disloyalty due to a perceived break in the rules, laws, and ideals of authority figures, whom I discriminated collectively as one whole.</p><p>I remember what it was like to taste salty water at the beach. It made me feel weird.</p><p>I remember what it felt like to listen to the cold rain inside a car. The rain would feel like thuds against the cage-like confines of the vehicle. The droplets leaning against the frontal window felt like a snowy mountain or a magical spell. The contrast between this awe and the often dim, dirty streets allowed me a divided look into modern life where I lived.</p><p>I remember the feeling of a large pile of trash on the road and seeing people grabbing items from it from inside a vehicle. The bright lights of street lights and cars pointing at them gave these scenes an cavernous feeling as if the sky was a ceiling.</p><p>After partially watching several videos pertaining to &ldquo;One Piece&rdquo; as a way to remember since I&rsquo;ve stopped watching at around 1,000 episodes several years ago, I remember the &ldquo;Cowboy Bebop&rdquo; feeling of those filler episodes the most because the main plot was so good that even filler felt like fresh juice spilled from the highest order. This is why Cowboy Bebop, which I watched after One Piece, fell short of hitting me as hard because One Piece initially generated in me that same excitement for an episodic, relaxed feeling despite being an action-packed and intense series at times. Rather than only One Piece, manga such as &ldquo;Hotel&rdquo; by the author &ldquo;Boiichi&rdquo; and many other sci-fi stories introduced me to the various themes that I ended up revisiting in Cowboy Bebop, so the experience was old and nostalgic rather than novel. Same goes for the first and second ending of &ldquo;Neon Genesis Evangelion.&rdquo; They were also old and nostalgic themes rather than revolutionary. Rather than only media (music, stories, and such), real-life experiences familiarized me with the vastly complex world and inner worlds of myself and others explored and reinterpreted again and again through the furtherance of knowledge gain through subsequent experiences. I became a person very first-hand in familiarity with the real world, whence interpretations are derived and produce themes within media.</p><p>I remember the feeling of drawing conclusions from the most specific sources: channels like Pursuit of Wonder. They were indeed philosophical but entirely subordinate to much ambiguity but enlightening to someone rather inept in philosophical topics, as I was raised in a Christian environment full of the conclusions of Biblical proverbial stories but semantically against the idea that it falls under the particularly mere term &ldquo;philosophical,&rdquo; which meant that traditional learning of philosophy would be limited due to dismissal of the term.</p><p>I remember the magical feeling of reading the book &ldquo;The Mistmantle Chronicles: Urchin of the Riding Stars.&rdquo; It was as if sparkles were flying in my head, and every scene felt like an &ldquo;angled&rdquo; glimpse into a world. It was my childhood version of &ldquo;Lord of my Rings,&rdquo; but I guess I only read tens of chapters at most and less than ten chapters at least. Though, I feel that I finished that book. If I did finish it, then that demonstrates its capacity for making me feel that time has passed.</p><p>I remember the feeling of reading this black knight anime book probably published in the US around 2000s.</p><p>After getting a look at some books downstairs, I saw a few books that reminded me of the many books I, my younger brothers, and my mother bought at Book Sale. We had the author John Vornholt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Troll King&rdquo; and &ldquo;Troll Queen.&rdquo; We also had this US book about a Japanese girl training to be a samarui or something from my cousin Jeremiah. I was supposed to be borrow it for only a short period, but it ended up getting torn. We also had Bionicle graphic novels.</p><p>I had a dream.</p><p>I remember climbing up a evenly diagonal slope instead of going a normal way toward a swimming pool at the top where Ram was and probaby David and Badjoy too. I was one hour late I believe when I arrived close to the top. I remember collapsing and Ram noticing me. He said he brought me to the hospital or something. I was tucked between in a small gap leading to Ram&rsquo;s swimming pool at the top. The slope was a very long ramp leading to a swimming pool at the top. A block the same length as the ramp but over 1 meter thick was set above the ramp with a small gap in between, running parallel with it. This gap was where I crawled. I remember that it even had a pergola above. It was a wooden structure with gridded roof, running parallel with the ramp and the block. Its roof had thin crossbeams interspersed with square paper.</p><p>In another scene or dream, I remember being with people I knew, probably the youth from my former main church or original church or members of the church network from other churches. I remember looking at some monitors in a line. We heard you could choose in which monitor a certain artwork would be shown. This was probably for a competition. I think I remember being a spectator rather than a participant in this competition. The room was dark, and we had passed through a door. The room was small and somewhat sling or long. The monitors were next to a wall, and we were next to a wall standing opposite to the monitors. The door was on this latter wall, which also had a glass window I believe.</p><p>In another scene or dream, I remember walking through a large office room full of people celebrating. I remember the room being very long horizontally. I remember hearing a voice of someone sort of saying that they wanted to be part of something like this too with the celebrating and seeming camaraderie. I remember walking to the back as far from the celebration as possible. I remember seeing so many people celebrating and that theywcw ere Japanese. The office was arranged like a airplane or Filipino bus wherein two sets of chairs on both sides with an aisle in the middle to walk through.</p><p>I remember seeing Ardy walk up to me and sit down hitting her head onto the back of the chair to the left of me somehow. I was worried, so I embraced her and soothed her head, leaning her against me. I remember that as I did that, after a while, she began to show feelings for me for some reason. 8 remember that she said that my brother David told her to take off her &ldquo;potatoes,&rdquo; which I determined to mean take off her bra and show her breasts. She had a drawl and looked drunk, tired, and desperate when she tried to keep embracing me or something. I think I remember that rather than only embracing me, she was trying to kiss me or something more serious. I remember avoiding her and saying that she was drunk or something. I really felt worried. I remember that she turned to a worm on the wall with my legs somehow raised and toward or leaning onto the wall. I was so scared because she was inching bit by bit toward my leg. This was all because I was scared of her liking me or something. I rember that seeing Ardy&rsquo;s older sister, Ate Faye, in the background when Ardy began to show infatuation. It&rsquo;s strange that I felt that Ate Faye left her be.</p><p>I most likely had other dreams or scenes that I forgot.</p><p>I remember the fact that we became habitualized to looking away when someone dies in League of Legends.</p><p>I remember the New Life weekly or maybe monthly gathering &ldquo;Crossroads&rdquo; for young adults and even older adults I think. That was the gathering wherein that older woman probably thought I was much older than I was before she soon asked me how old I was with that other girl who asked about my education and to which I replied that I was in an accelerated education.</p><p>I remember playing the board game Snakes and Ladders with my siblings. I remember the pieces. I have the exact image of what it looks like.</p><p>I remember my mother incorrectly saying something along the lines &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it as much as I could.&rdquo; She kept using &ldquo;could&rdquo; incorrectly, and I think I only corrected her once on it or maybe it was one of my siblings.</p><p>I remember seeing people with Domo-kun depicted on their bags. I think I remember someone with Domo-kun attached to their pen or something. Maybe even a Domo-kun as a bag charm or accessory.</p><p>Among the many toys we had, we had &ldquo;Operation&rdquo; invented by &ldquo;John Spinello.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember watching &ldquo;Meteor 60 Seconds!&rdquo; and &ldquo;60 Seconds!&rdquo;</p><p>I remember that I (and maybe my siblings) would say &ldquo;imaginating&rdquo; instead of the correct form &ldquo;imagining.&rdquo;</p><p>Expressions I made up:
&ldquo;Yokseekan,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Squidilicious,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Rofler Dolfer,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ro-f-ler Do-l-fe-r,&rdquo;
&ldquo;checkie outie&rdquo; or something like that,
&ldquo;Hurriah!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Huyyah!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nutbrains&rdquo; is a combination I made up between nuts and brains.</p><p>&ldquo;Madyak&rdquo; is a word I made up to mean extremely mad. I use it usually to exaggerate.</p><p>Made-up words that don&rsquo;t mean anything:
&ldquo;Doughzhi&rdquo; (at least it&rsquo;s pronounced that way),
&ldquo;Kikishkarla,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Arlavushki,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yikyam,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ayafuf,&rdquo;</p><p>Gen Z Lingo I use:
&ldquo;Sheesh,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Aight,&rdquo;</p><p>Phrases that I say:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going fucking haywire.&rdquo;</p><p>I think I remember I and my siblings would use the made-up word &ldquo;morer.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember thinking that the jetpack man &ldquo;robot&rdquo; in Incredibots 2 was so high-tech and difficult to make when I first saw it.</p><p>When I looked at an vector image of a classroom, I remembered the anime &ldquo;My Hero Academia,&rdquo; the anime &ldquo;Classroom of the Elite,&rdquo; and 2009 British film &ldquo;Exam,&rdquo; which I watched through a movie recap Youtube video.</p><p>I remember watching many short films on Youtube, especially that of &ldquo;Omeleto&rdquo; and &ldquo;DUST,&rdquo; two short film curators. From Omeleto, I&rsquo;ve watched &ldquo;The Box,&rdquo; &ldquo;Snake Bite,&rdquo; &ldquo;Locker Room,&rdquo; &ldquo;The iMom,&rdquo; &ldquo;Long Branch,&rdquo; &ldquo;Turning Tide,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Narrow World,&rdquo; &ldquo;Trunk Space,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lazy Boy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Exit Strategy,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Disappearance of Willie Bingham,&rdquo; &ldquo;No More Wings,&rdquo; &ldquo;Corporate Monster,&rdquo; &ldquo;Holding,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Occupant,&rdquo; &ldquo;Joseph&rsquo;s Reel,&rdquo; &ldquo;Avarya,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dig Your Own Grave,&rdquo; &ldquo;Uncanny Valley,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m You, Dickhead,&rdquo; &ldquo;Discipline,&rdquo; &ldquo;Runner,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fire&rdquo; (maybe), &ldquo;So You&rsquo;ve Grown Attached,&rdquo; &ldquo;A New Man,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lasirius,&rdquo; among others. From DUST, I&rsquo;ve watched &ldquo;deep clean,&rdquo; &ldquo;exit strategy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;arzok.&rdquo; Maybe I&rsquo;ve watched more from them.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve watched a short film called &ldquo;The sky&rdquo; by Matt Sears here on Youtube. I&rsquo;ve other short films, including &ldquo;One-minute time machine&rdquo; by Devon Avery, among others.</p><p>I had a tiny psychotic break when I was a child when I suddenly woke up in the middle night and was terrified that I had kissed my mother. (I didn&rsquo;t kiss my mother, but for some reason, I felt that it was so.) My mother calmed me, and I went back to sleep next to her, crying I think.</p><p>I remember going to Baguio Night Market.</p><p>Pine Country Steaks And Waffles</p><p>MCA and NCA were both Christian private schools, as my parents preferred private schools over public schools.</p><p>I think it&rsquo;s only now (7/29/2023 1:32 PM) after over a decade that I made the connection that SuperTux is using the mascot of &ldquo;Linux OS.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember when I saw mods that enable nudity of women in Skyrim on the desktop wherein my eldest half-brother Kuya Paulo played. I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was Kuya Paulo who installed them; though, I did think it was my older half-brother David who installed it at first.</p><p>I remember when Desiree, a former youth from my former main church or original church, told me to let the dish soap handle the hard bits on kitchenware instead of water since I had a habit of using water. I think Kuya Michael, Jeremiah&rsquo;s older brother, voiced a similar statement toward me. I&rsquo;ve remembered Desiree&rsquo;s statement throughout the years faintly from time to time while washing kitchenware.</p><p>I remember a image of the past when my mother threw shoes at me back at the former place I and my family lived in, the apartment. She was angry, and I was crying. She mentioned this several times thereafter, especially this one time a few years ago in a discussion concerning my episodic bursts of anger.</p><p>I had a dream.</p><p>I remember that I was going onto a set of white metal bars, each of which were of different sizes but averaged around the height of 12 inches. They were horizontal and probably attached to legs at the sides somehow, at least one meter off the ground because they diverged in altitude as well. When I went on top of them, I was lying onto them and moving my torso to travel across them. I remember going at the farthest end of them and probably falling off in between two bars. I remember hitting the ground and packing my things because they scattered. I remember having a rectangular container having around 16 blocks of, half of which was maybe 2 centimeters and another half was probably over 4 centimeters. I remember they were standing and lined up horizontally inside the open container. I remember that the CEO of the company I was apparently in made this whole metal bar set as part of a routinary exercise or something for the employees, which included me I think.</p><p>At the farther side of the metal bar set, I think there was a thin wall. I think to the left of this wall was a gap and then another thin wall.</p><p>I remember that people were talking to the CEO concerning the strangeness of his routinary exercise for his employees and possibly how dangerous it was since I was literally going onto the metal bars somehow, then falling, and hitting the ground, which counts as exercise somehow. I also remember that the impact of the fall was gentle to me.</p><p>While arranging or playing with the blocks in the container, I remember hearing Andrew Tate talking with someone regarding him liking 18-year-old girls. He said they were cute and that he visited one of them. I think I heard that he married one of them and her girlfriend.</p><p>This phenomenon of hearing &ldquo;talking head&rdquo; voices in a dream happened before, specifically that talking can still occur despite the absence of the person talking. The &ldquo;detached voice&rdquo; talking of the CEO and someone is a good example of this.</p><p>Again, after documenting my dreams, my feelings have been largely robotic or distant within them besides my desire to document them afterwards. The emotional aspect of the dreams remains to be determined if my emotions being subordinated to my analytical perspective when I take quick action to document them is true.</p><p>While lying down, I would regularly take on various lying positions, ranging from mild to strange, to compensate for the discomforts introduced by lingering in one position for too long.</p><p>I remember crying and being vulnerable in a Starbucks. The reason I could do so was that it was so noisy and there was many people. Some might have heard me, but in my culture, people tend to mind their own business and avoid staring at one another.</p><p>I remember my mother continually celebrating the fact she had 6 children. I realize now that it&rsquo;s because we live in a third world country (developing country) wherein child mortality rate is even worse than minority populations in the U.S. have.</p><p>I see now that my mother was rather protective of us in a way. As a family, we traveled on birthdays and some events, but for the rest of our days, we ate only food at home with a few, rare exceptions. My mother even chose homeschooling over public school, but it was also for financial reasons. It was a good thing we had computers in the 2000s to 2010s because my father was a web developer. Having access to computers and the Internet prevented my home schooled siblings from losing touch with the world. They also had many books and films and various ways to express themselves.</p><p>Because I have astigmatism, lights look blurry, streaky, and distorted. Sometimes, as a child, especially before I got my glasses, I would curiously squint my eyes to manipulate the streaks of light, making them become longer or rotate to a certain direction. They look like sparkles, and I would be able to control two coupled points of it by squinting.</p><p>I remember the first time I got glasses. I remarked that everything was in HD (High Definition). My grade is &ldquo;-2.50&rdquo;, but I think I remember that my determination of what&rsquo;s comfortable for me has changed. It might be higher now.</p><p>I remember when I watched Ssundee&rsquo;s first episode of his playthrough of the game &ldquo;Terra Tech,&rdquo; which was released on the sixth of February on 2015. The year 2015 still felt pretty novel to me at the time, so according to my memories, 2015 aligns well with this first episode. This episode was published on Jul 23, 2015.</p><p>I remember watching through the beginning of this episode and enjoying every second. I remember watching Ssundee go through the basics of the game, enraptured.</p><p>I remember the student orientation in my first year at MCA. I felt strangely curious, looking around a lot.</p><p>I remember seeing my youngest brother Timothy play &ldquo;Plants Vs Zombies Heroes&rdquo; on a phone.</p><p>I remember when we rode car and truck toys for a children&rsquo;s game I made for my siblings. I remember making up so many children&rsquo;s games for my siblings, which may have contributed to my inclination toward developing Roblox games.</p><p>One of the outdoor games I played alongside various youth in my original church and in church network events was this game where we each placed a pencil in between our noses and upper lips and at the philtrum in and squeezed it with muscles of both nose and upper lips to hold it. Holding onto the pencil was the challenge, and we would include the challenge of walking back and forth from a point A to a point and back. Furthermore, since this was a team game, we would have to pass the pencil onto the next teammate&rsquo;s philtrum somehow until each teammate did a lap with the pencil. Whoever&rsquo;s team finished first won. Since it was an awkward activity involving facial muscles, participants would often laugh.</p><p>I think I remember seeing a classmate or two hold a pencil between their nose and upper lip. I think I remember a former NCA classmate, Clarence, doing it.</p><p>I remember the drawing of a former MCA classmate Kyra, who used this to compete for National Student Convention. It was NSC 2017 I think. I think the drawing involved colored pencils and depicted a lion or a tiger.</p><p>For some reason, I remember a former MCA classmate Rovi Evangelista saying that another classmate in his grade, Clara, was beautiful during the graduation or end-of-the-year party or something. I rememberCiarahaving tied hair with braids. Maybe it was Chinese-styled.</p><p>I remember an icebreaker game where we would sustain the last syllable of &ldquo;Happy birthday!&rdquo; for as long as possible, counting along with a stopwatch. I think it included variations such as &ldquo;Merry Christmas!&rdquo; I remember a member of my former original church, Eddie Fernandez, often taking on the role of facilitator for this game.</p><p>I remember that during some events at my original church, I would see the pews set on the side atop one another. I remember helping my mother set them. I remember helping her stack and set lots of chairs.</p><p>I remember staring at the floor of my former original church. I think it was marble. I remember analyzing the textures and the various shapes depicted on it. I remember thinking one time while staring at it that I would remember this moment for the rest of my life. Now, I remember it. I would often stare at it while eating the church-provided food or while listening to a sermon by the former pastor.</p><p>I remember the feeling of lying down on that floor on the altar or stage. I remember that during a small sleepover with the former youth members, I fell asleep and woke up to hear the faint echo of the voices of those who were awake nearby.</p><p>I remember that when I was much younger, I would make &ldquo;homework&rdquo; for my younger siblings. I remember that I would write and draw a matching task. I think I also included a question and answer task. I think I remember drawing boxes for where the written answer should be inside. The homework project is related to my desire to make games for my younger siblings because it was so fun. Additionally, many times, I remarked that I wanted to teach them or aid them pedagogically with an belief in uplifting or empowering them.</p><p>I remember that when I placed a roll of Japanese paper of a certain color onto the bar light attached to the wall, I felt like I was in a cave with the light acting as peeking sunlight from the entrance of this cave.</p><p>I remember that when I had long hair, it was annoying to have my nape getting covered all the time. I also remembered getting annoyed that I had to keep my hair out of my ear. I remember disliking the fact that I had to spent more effort to put on more shampoo.</p><p>On the other hand, I remember that when I got a buzzcut, I felt that only needing to put on small amount of shampoo was so quick and convenient.</p><p>I remember that one of the parts I enjoyed in the anime Overlord, besides the scenes with Demiurge, was the arc with the lizardfolk.</p><p>I notice a behavior of mine since I began to write an autobiography, which meant looking at old photos and old games that I played. When I look back at something and remember suddenly my memories with shock, I sometimes ever so slightly rock back and forth.</p><p>I remember playing the Roblox game &ldquo;Build to Survive the Zombies&rdquo; (BTSTZ) with great detail after looking at a video of someone playing it in Aug 19, 2016. I remember the &ldquo;Stamper Tool&rdquo; that allowed you to place down ramps and blocks of various materials such as slate, ice, mahogany, stone, granite, grass, brick, maple. I would use the Stamper in order to build on the small baseplate designated to my player. I remember the doorway with lazers that displayed a &ldquo;Roblox decal&rdquo; image of the avatar of the player. It was called &ldquo;Friend Only Door - Hostile&rdquo; I remember the feeling of playing 1.5.2 Minecraft around this time as well at the same time that I remembered the memories of playing BTSTZ. I remember the feeling of being content with the simple builds that I created in BTSTZ. I remember the excitement and enjoyment of seeing my name displayed on screen along with other names who survived a round of a wave of zombies attacking. I remember the old player list or leaderboard, the old healthbars above the players, and old chat bubbles.</p><p>I remember the various different leaderboard statistics and how enjoyable it was to have it set up in my own Roblox game. I remember one time being engaged in increasing a statistic at many points during the peak of my Roblox gaming experience.</p><p>Of course, I shifted slowly to making my own Roblox games, but I still enjoyed plenty of the popular Roblox games even during that time.</p><p>I remember enjoying the feeling of changing up the chat design with scripts in Roblox Studio.</p><p>I remember another &ldquo;Roblox default tool,&rdquo; Insert Tool.</p><p>I remember the satisfying feeling of seeing the Builder&rsquo;s Club logo along with the old default GUI, especially the health bar statically floating on the screen.</p><p>I remember the red outline around my screen whenever I pressed &ldquo;F12&rdquo; while in a Roblox game, which meant I was recording my &ldquo;Roblox Player&rdquo; window. I remember accidentally pressing this button many times whenever I wanted to go fullscreen by pressing &ldquo;F11&rdquo;.</p><p>I remember pressing the screenshot button &ldquo;F2&rdquo; many times whenever I played Minecraft.</p><p>I think I remember having Roblox &ldquo;friends,&rdquo; or people who accepted my friend request or people whose friend request to me I accepted, who were &ldquo;Turbo Builders Club&rdquo; and &ldquo;Outrageous Builders Club.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember the Roblox default tool &ldquo;Delete Tool,&rdquo; which I used often in BTSTZ.</p><p>I remember the various categories of the Stamper Tool such as &ldquo;Basic Building,&rdquo; &ldquo;Advanced Building,&rdquo; &ldquo;House Kit,&rdquo; &ldquo;House Interior Kit,&rdquo; &ldquo;Landscape,&rdquo; &ldquo;Castle Kit,&rdquo; &ldquo;Castle Interior Kit,&rdquo; &ldquo;Space Kit,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fun Machines,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Deadly Machines.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember crying when I got trashtalked for probably the first time or second time in League of Legends. I think I was still 11 or 12 when that happened. It happened during a game where I and David played with Jerry. I think Jerry was in a computer shop while I was at home or maybe in another computer shop. In another game, I remember playing Rammus at the computer shop far up in Agro Homes Subd.</p><p>I remember the various beautiful buildings I saw other players create in BTSTZ.</p><p>I remember the existence of various clones of BTSTZ. I believe I enjoyed some of these clones.</p><p>2003–9 is a melting pot of memories.</p><p>I remember the feeling of taking a shower, putting on two layers of clothes and shoes as preparation to exit the house for a family outing only for my siblings to greet me with the fact that they are still asleep or doing something like playing video games. I would just sit down and wait. For many years, I would disengage from media and sit down or walk outside, but after a long time, I just ended up lying down on the coach and letting myself rest while engaging in something, especially reading an e-book. If you had a camera directed at me 24/7, you would notice that differences of my behavior as time passed. Of course, the spectrum of my behavior with all its various mannerisms is variable and, at many times, hard to decipher. Despite this, the underlying mechanism of my postulation that over the years, my outward bearing have undergone transmutations along with my developments is rational.</p><p>I remember the feeling of going downstairs the cement steps of my home. My movements were sportive like a small goat waiting for his mother&rsquo;s milk. Each time, I gamboled down the stairs like a goat herder mischievously waiting for a sign of the sun. My body, as it were, was an older man who had regained youth. Sometimes, I span down the way down or up the stairs with a trifle pause in my choreographed sequence of movements, often in a trancing dance, as a way to end a repeated section of my famed stairway dance. At the end of my steps, I sauntered like a strongman as I opened an entryway, the door to my room, accepting the responsibilities and requests which the long-term memory of my mind timely reserved and retracted for my entry and exit of this room, respectively.</p><p>This room was where I extended myself within.</p><p>I remember the precisely timed action of ending my stairway dance, after which I slid my hand along the form which I had conceptualized of the fridge, the denoted region wherein the axons conveying the suggestion of the contraction of my arm activated. This deep-set production of sensorimotor stimulation and conscious awareness of the established act stems from the repetitive nature of this decisional mannerism, which started from a express desire to communicate kinesthetically the byzantine nature of the mind wherein the personality resides.</p><p>I proceeded to find my hands entering and exiting the fridge with two succinct movements like a chef warming up for a long day.</p><p>I remember the spin of my brain as I read the books, but it was like a thick wall which my brain entertained outside of my awareness. Studying textbooks stimulated the brain but adjured me into further inquiry. Finally, once coupled with my continuous application of that knowledge, it was there wherein my actions and mouth gained wisdom which I might display before I even begun to accept. It was within that collation of knowledge with which my emotions have yet to couple that I witnessed my anxiety and bumbling intuitive perceptions systemized for the acquisition of further stimulation of conative sets.</p><p>I think I have woken up at least once at home all alone because my family went outside. It must have been because I was sleeping that they left me at home.</p><p>I remember banging my second-to-youngest brother Peter&rsquo;s head against the cabinet in our home when I was younger. I remember him beginning to cry. I remember how he would rub his eyes with both hands when he cried.</p><p>Now, it hurts to think about it. I really am a horrible person.</p><p>I remember the cabinet and the spotted pattern of the top of it. It had two sections, one with the spotted pattern and another with a wall. The former section had a receptacle with double doors that led to a small space around 3.5 feet wide. I remember the somewhat ornate handles of both doors. The top and bottom of these handles looked the same, but the top was facing up while the bottom faced down. They looked like very slender forms of top of the king chess piece. They were brown, more red than orange. The wood of the rest of the cabinet was brown, but it looked more orange. Each door had set of two joints at the upper-middle portion and another set at the bottom-middle portion. The top of the latter section was separated into two portions along with an enclosure with three sides between these portions. The portion on the side where one would find a receptacle that mirrored the receptacle of the former section was much lower than the top of the former section. The other portion, in terms of height, was either in the middle of the former portion and the top of the former section or was the same as the top of the former section. The former portion included a hole leading to the receptacle below it at its topmost rightmost side. The enclosure was a few inches thick and only extended within the boundaries of the latter section. The bottom of the cabinet had a portion measuring approximately less than a feet was coated black. I remember that it housed sports items and board games at a certain point of time. I remember that either my mother, my sister, or both referred to the cabinet as a cafe countertop; although, it looked quite complex with the receptacles and the enclosure to be a simple flat countertop. I remember that the double doors of one of the two sections had at least one noticeably joint.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve felt regret over what I did to Peter, but it feels disgusting to delineate the extent of my regret over it and many other sins because I feel that it only serves to distract from my faults.</p><p>This autobiography is to be vulnerable and face my past because I had a fulfilling life but also because I am forgetting.</p><p>I remember that my father said that he or Kuya Paulo played the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game &ldquo;League of Legends&rdquo; (LOL) when it was released on October 27, 2009.</p><p>The extent to which the game has changed over the years makes it challenging for me to delinate my history with it.</p><p>I remember playing the early version of the &ldquo;champion&rdquo; &ldquo;Warwick&rdquo; and enjoying it. I kept playing him along with &ldquo;Mundo&rdquo; and &ldquo;Xin Zhao.&rdquo; They were very easy to play at the time.</p><p>I remember playing Rammus in one of my first &ldquo;games,&rdquo; or a single round when referencing LOL, possibly the first game. However, it might have been the earliest image or memory because it was one of the first times, possibly the first time, I played with others rather than one of the first times, or the first time, I played the game itself.</p><p>I remember the feeling of being curious about the way LOL looked like. I probably perked up at the sound of the gold, the way each champion moved, the animation and sound effects involved in a tower&rsquo;s destruction, the sound of the voiced quotes of each champion, and the stringed instrument and the drums at the champion selection stage before the actual round. I might have stared at the design of the health bars while pondering its relation to the other video games I played, probably flash games which I found on sites such as &ldquo;Y8.com&rdquo; at the time.</p><p>I remember playing lots of games where I fought bots (computer-automated players) and enjoying that more than the human &ldquo;Player versus player&rdquo; (PvP). This long period of playing only against bots could have occurred right around when I first started or probably later on after playing a series of games with my siblings and friends. I think I remember playing against bots for around or over a year. The time period probably aligned with my growing interest and probing into the concept of artificial intelligence which, throughout my formative years, I explored intensely, especially through coding and programming, using the &ldquo;game engine&rdquo; Roblox Studio. Naturally, it was much more simpler, distinct from the more advanced type of intelligent agent, artificial general intelligence.</p><p>I remember the feeing of queuing up to play a round against bots again and again until I became attached to the user interface (UI) design where I selected a button that led me to play against bots. I remember the introduction of more advanced bots with the inclusion of &ldquo;Intro&rdquo;, &ldquo;Beginner&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Intermediate&rdquo; and feeling excited when I saw the more sophisticated behavior of the hardest difficulty option &ldquo;Intermediate&rdquo; on the official LOL website or on the &ldquo;Client&rdquo;, the separate software application that served as the launcher and interface for players to access the game.</p><p>I remember feeling proud of the bots when I studied their new behavior.</p><p>The early UI OF LOL was charming, and the selection borders around each champion and the &ldquo;skins,&rdquo; the alternate appearances, emphasized the complementary way the 2D art and the sound of the repeatedly voiced quote that represented the champion.</p><p>I remember how fun it was to play with the items which champions could buy from the store: &ldquo;Atla&rsquo;s Impaler,&rdquo; &ldquo;Avarice Blade,&rdquo; &ldquo;Catalyst the Protector,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rod of Ages,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wit&rsquo;s End.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember the sound of gold when I bought an item and the satisfying manner of my gold increasing, which was represented through a number floating on my screen. I remember the sound of selecting each category in the store. I remember faintly a smell aligning with all these visual and auditory memories together.</p><p>I remember the feeling of my caution against dust and the refreshing but challenging affect of sweeping the floor of my house. The numerous and pervading moments of everyday chores such as sweeping the floor contributed to my healthy understanding of a structured and disciplined routine while indoors.</p><p>I remember hearing that my older half-brother David pooped on the green-coated cement porch of our old house.</p><p>When I was still small and wearing a sleeveless undershirt which Peter would soon wear, based on images from Facebook, we had a hamster even at our old house, which was mysterious because I was sure that I remembered the adoption of a hamster being a much later event.</p><p>In regard to the passing down of clothes, my family struggled financially with debt, and any new clothes was often the result of passing down and gifts from wealthier relatives.</p><p>I remember the itchy discomfort of wearing tight pants, which was part of the dress code at MCA, because the hair on my legs was thick enough that vibrations against it resulted in the overstretching of my leg hair and my concomitant skin irritation. After probably weeks or months, with my mother&rsquo;s help, I requested bigger pants. This occurred during my first school year at MCA around 6 years ago.</p><p>I remember a certain sleeveless undershirt which my youngest brother Timothy coated with colors either via paint or crayons.</p><p>I remember a distinct image of Timothy smiling and jumping up and down on his fluffy playpen at the old house.</p><p>I remember another image before Timothy&rsquo; birth where my mother was standing at the other end of the old house and with a visible bulge indicating pregnancy. She was pregnant with Timothy at the time. Soon after giving birth to Timothy, she had a visible vertical scar across her belly.</p><p>Feeling a trifle overwhelmed as I recall and document the past, I wrote two fictitious accounts in response: &ldquo;I remember the feeling of holding a knife about to strike everything that my family stood for—the good, the bad, and the beautiful. All of this was prepared for my time to shine. I would become the epitome of grace and beauty. In this place, I would shed the blood of those who I called my own. I would engage in the murder of good saints with all their flaws because I am manic and free, lost in everything and going to lose everything. However, this time, it would be forever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I remember eating the flesh of my kind. It tasted like scrumptious chicken. I hungered about like a stinky man, eating whatever I could find. It tasted like joyous praise like apple pie mixed with sugar that only became delicious as one tasted it. I was free in the sphere of everything, falling like an everpresent guide of this reality.&rdquo;</p><p>My mother was always going outside and doing her own thing after she became involved with the church. She became the kind of person who would leave us at home. I never ascribed it as neglectful, but after looking back after so many years and after writing over 76,000 words of memory and life, my mother was hyper-focused on church activities. Her altruism may have been an ego defense mechanism to deal with her very troubled traumatic and abused childhood. My father was essentially a saving grace in terms of financially supporting and accounting for her large separation from her old life. Nevertheless, she maintained lies and emotions that lingered in her since the birth of my eldest half-brother Kuya Paulo all the way up to now probably 26 years later. My father lost his father when he was only nine years old, and his mother was similarly neglectful especially toward the bullying he experienced from his older brother. The deprivations in parenting that my father exhibited, specifically through the lack of empathy and emotional and physical abuse. This culmination of experiences, along with manifold factors of which I am ignorant, led to the multivariate emotional and experiential deprivations my siblings and I face right now. One of the deterrents of a loss of life through suicide or poverty (in a developing or third world country) was the social mobility which my family experienced through my father&rsquo;s promotions at work. This is a very brief and limited look into my life, so please regard this as such.</p><p>I remember saying and writing down that it would be fine if I died because I already lived a fulfilling life and any more [living] would turn me into a horrible person.</p><p>I also remarked many times regarding my father, &ldquo;I will become just like him,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not different!&rdquo;, and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the same!&rdquo;</p><p>I have said that I wanted to stay single because I was a monster (like my father).</p><p>Paradoxically, despite my proclaimed desire to be a good person, I am goal-oriented, which depends upon a self-oriented nature rather than utilizing a focus of all my efforts into the direct betterment of others thanks to my perception of the characteristics which call upon &ldquo;helping&rdquo; itself. That my repeated attempts to help others failed was why I drilled into my head the lesson that one may want to help but lack the abilities necessary to help others effectively and in a manner that precluded a prefiguration of impinging reaction formations.</p><p>I remember playing several rounds in &ldquo;Point Blank,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Team Fortress 2.&rdquo; I remember playing plenty of rounds in &ldquo;Awesomenauts.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember playing &ldquo;Scribblenauts&rdquo; on console with Jeremiah at his old house.</p><p>I remember struggling often with intrusive thoughts as part of an interplay which include depression and anxiety. The period when I had my most impinging intrusive thoughts was during the six years after I quit school. The decree of severity most likely fluctuated throughout, but a downtrend of the severity aligned with passing time. The intrusive thoughts predominantly contained imaginal self-harm and suicide. One of my most visited coping mechanisms was listening to music and playing it. I sought a mental health professional and engaged with him for many months, even taking anti-psychotic medication for a short period. During one of my first visits to the therapist, I learned that he diagnosed me with bipolar I disorder with psychotic features. After spending so much time contemplating self-directed violence, I began to feel disdain toward my father, who repeatedly displayed interpretable callousness and frustration toward me and my siblings as a result of our byzantine circumstances. After suppressing myself for way over a year or two years, I exploded in a mental breakdown involving inappropriate laughter, but my father reacted callously and berated me. This &ldquo;laughing&rdquo; mental breakdown continued, occuring on an average of every two months. My father continued to impinge upon me severely, exacerbating my conditions. He even slapped me on the face, which felt way more humiliating and invalidating than hitting me with a belt. This broke me further and was a signifcant contributor to the emergence of violent thoughts which were directed outside myself toward my father. These outward-facing violent affects were still new to me because they were much more serious and premeditated than before. After many years, they worsened to the point that I was capable even to convince myself that murder was acceptable because in my head, I believed that it would help me and my siblings, who especially struggled under my father&rsquo;s callous and narcissistic behavior and my mother&rsquo;s neglectful, enabling deportment. The repeated themes of moral integrity during our weekly visits to church served as both a hope and exacerbator amid the perceived hypocritical breaking of physically established rules.</p><p>My father still believes that he did everything that a father was supposed to do, which I am exhausted of disputing. I am writing and releasing publicly this autobiography interconnected with many other material, which exposes and leaves me vulnerable, in case everything falls apart.</p><p>I remember often imitating voices. Kuya Glenn was a socio-interpersonal-physiological model who accounted for the emergence within me of learning behavior directed toward the consummation of a deep voice which was a physicality he possessed and which I practiced often, subsequently altered my physiology, and occasionally contemplated as an approach to voice acting.</p><p>The relationship between Kuya Glenn and Ate Danielle affected my learning behavior psychologically.</p><p>I met five people, hundreds of people, more than a thousand people, and yet I&rsquo;ve forgotten them along with the pains, concerns, and accomplishments which I&rsquo;ve seen of them.</p><p>I had a dream about a mansion of some sort. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I wrote this down before, but that written note remains to be discovered.</p><p>In this dream, I entered a mansion and greeted a person at a registration table. I remember walking alongside a group of people, probably friends. I remember that the person at the table was a beautiful woman. I remember passing her and then turning my toward her and locking eyes with her. We probably exchanged words in this moment. I remember a horse outside the window while talking to some male official in the middle of the large room wherein the table and the woman was. I think I remember Ram being there. I remember seeing many horses inside I think. Or maybe it was only one or several. These horses inside might have had armor. I remember sitting down at a table. I remember sitting next to Timothy I think. I remember doing something strange, which —I think—after I woke up, then praised for some reason I forgot.</p><p>I remember listening to this particular Christian song which was part of an edited video in a CD. We used to keep playing this video, so even while I was young in this current house, I felt deep nostalgia already.</p><p>I remember when Timothy, Peter, David, and I would use blankets to sleep. I remember that we slept together on the floor and on the double-deck bed upstairs.</p><p>I remember seeing Kuya Paulo sleeping on the top of the double-deck bed. David would also sleep there.</p><p>I remember eating hotdog sandwiches at the convenience store &ldquo;7-Eleven&rdquo; many times there near Muntinlupa City Hall and the printing shop &ldquo;Arkishop&rdquo; where my mother used to work.</p><p>I remember when an older woman approached me in New Life, tapping me and then said something about a job at &ldquo;Soldiers&rdquo; or something. I was at the area to the right of the lobby area. I think the former area had a canteen, and I remember a Christmas tree there too next to the lobby area. I remember seeing a person praying there probably for an event or something. It might have been an occasional prayer during Christmas.</p><p>I remember struggling with itchy hands rarely, which I think was because of rashes.</p><p>I remember the cheese sticks I ate from a vendor riding a bike attached to a metal container with a wheel. This vendor only appeared a few times on the street in front of the store across the street to our house.</p><p>I remember the distinct smell of coffee and the feeling of steam when I placed my chin on the edge of the tumbler and face within. I remember the semi-affluent feeling of having a tumbler situated next to me on a table as I sat especially when sitting on a bus, in a cafe, or at an event indoors. I remember the set of smells of Quezon City, especially the smell of Lola Cecille&rsquo;s house.</p><p>I remember the shelf that used to be hanging on the wall in the middle of the flight of stairs in our house. We removed it and replaced it with a painting.</p><p>I remember playing a &ldquo;Minecraft&rdquo; mod implementing zombies and modifying *world generation.&rdquo; I remember enjoying it due to the interplay of the &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo; nature of Minecraft, wherein I could change the environment by adding and breaking &ldquo;blocks&rdquo; which make up the environment, and the seemingly more established nature of the mod wherein I looked for guns, ammo, and various loot in chests scattered in buildings interspaced regularly throughout to survive zombies which I think follow you even from very far away compared to native Minecraft zombies. I remember the gritty textures despite the pixel art which I had associated heavily with the natural world and &ldquo;friendly horseplay&rdquo; action console games. This mod was \href{https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dayz-minecraft}{&ldquo;DayZ For Minecraft&rdquo;}.</p><p>The fact that I could choose keyboard shortcuts for certain activations in the phyics sandbox game series &ldquo;Incredibots&rdquo; was most likely formative to my touch typing profiency.</p><p>I remember the VIP rooms in Roblox where if you have VIP and touch the transparent doors, you pass through rather than die. This rooms normally contain buttons that give you money or something. These transparent, killing doors are also seen in another applications such as keeping out anyone other than the owner of a house for example.</p><p>I remember we would often do potlucks at certain events in my former main church.</p><p>Sequence of my shower routine.</p><p>When I turn on the shower, I sometimes put my hair first while standing far back if I feel particularly cold and put my whole body under the shower. As soon as the water hits me, I often hop and spin around to maximize the amount of water hitting me.</p><p>When I pick up the soap, I always start with the arm pits, then chest, then front part of the upper arms, then front, middle, and side part of the shoulders, then the nape, then front of the neck, then belly, then sides of the torso, then the perineum, then front part of the legs, then bottom part of the right thigh which I set on the edge of the toilet, then the knees, then outer side of the calves, then the rest of the legs, then the back, and then the feet.</p><p>I either wash off the soap and then put shampoo or just put shampoo while I still have soap on me.</p><p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been using conditioner and only using shampoo every so often after searching for a while regarding hair, curly hair, shampoo, and conditioner, among others. Before, I would always use the same shampoo brand &ldquo;Palmolive&rdquo; everyday. Rarely did I deviate from it.</p><p>I remember Jeremiah using &ldquo;Heads and Shoulders.&rdquo; I remember a bunch of expensive-looking shampoo or conditioner brands in a shelf rack hanging by the wall in their house.</p><p>I remember my sister telling me that I need to use the flat sponge to clean out tough food residues, which implied that I should use the softer, voluminous sponge for everything else.</p><p>I saw on the Incredibots recently as of writing (2023-08-04 09:02:07) that someone told me that I posting too fast and in oversized fonts. However, based on the history, my past self had yet to comprehend that concern because apparently, I still used oversized fonts.</p><p>My scrotum itched enough times for me to remember it faintly as soon as I needed to adjust my penis along with my undergarments, scrotum hair, and short trousers.</p><p>I remember this Roblox game where I had to type in chat what an image was (ex. a certain video game character) in order to pass a door (which, in the case of Roblox games, was just a square part blocking my way). I had to pass as much doors as possible.</p><p>I remember watching many cartoon shows such as Ben 10.</p><p>I remember when my former classmate Paul made me upset to the point that I discreetly went out of the room and began to cry. It&rsquo;s always the passive, leading words laced with a venomous, mocking, disdainful expression as if I was some horrible creature that hurt me. The first thing I remember when I think of that incident is me crying outside the two classrooms next to one another, one of which was where I studied. I think this is what I remember first because my former classmate Rovi Evangelista opened the door, peeked at me, and asked if I was okay, which made the mitigated the brunt of this long-term memory. I said that I was okay, wiped my eyes, and put my glasses back on.</p><p>I remember when my sister looked at me with a certain disdainful look while I was trying to learn how to do push-ups. Even, as a child, I could tell the difference between friendliness, a natural face, and disdain because I only saw that disdainful look coupled with venomous words from particularly virulent individuals. My sister exhibited a particular intolerance toward me. In many occasions, she showed a distinct intolerance toward my singing and toward my participation in the youth group of our church. It&rsquo;s easy to say it was a misunderstanding, but she was the kind of person to lie about having a boyfriend. When my older brother David took a picture of her lying down with a guy in her room, my sister used that very notorious stern expression as if what she was doing was justified. She used this same expression every time she scolded my younger siblings, which felt particularly that of annoyance rather than of constructive care. Many years later, she even expressed her disinterest and intolerance toward raising children. When I saw her express her pain from her experience in her school days because of her boyfriend, who was different from the aforementioned boyfriend and who used to be her bully, I felt confused, which coupled with the many confusions I had as a growing adolescent regarding moral integrity and hypocrisy, which I studied many times during sermons in church. For a long time, I&rsquo;ve held the assumption that she was jealous of me. The fact that we shared the same mother but had separate fathers, especially in the family life where my father was her acting father, supported this idea. Many years later, in present day, I feel a certain detachment from her, which was partly the reason I fantasized and lusted over her a year ago. It was a really strange fixation that stopped after a few months.</p><h3 id=everybody-loves-large-chests>Everybody Loves Large Chests

I remember seeing the various open fields in the distance. I imagined it because I had experience reading manga set in the isekai fantasy universe. I remember the various little monsters hiding in the dungeons. I imagined wolves probably and slimes, so when I learned that the protagonist killed the</p><p>I remember when David showed me a &ldquo;Top 10 List&rdquo; video of &ldquo;creepypastas,&rdquo; which terrified me and gave me nightmares I think. I became very scared of the dark, so I think it was traumatic.</p><p>Around this time, I was also watching horror games I think like Slenderman. I think I had an explosion of interest toward it. I remember getting glimpse of Pewdiepie as well, but since he swore, I avoided watching him.</p><p>I think that around this time as well, I was watching Minecaft Youtubers like ExplodingTNT and most likely DanTDM, Ssundee, Logdotzip, CaptainSparklez, Vikkstar, Bajancanadian, Preston, Bashur, and MinecraftUniverse, among others.</p><p>I remember that Peter often used MinecraftUniverse&rsquo;s skin by typing his name in the Minecraft 1.15.2 Launcher.</p><h3 id=triggering-section>Triggering Section
<a class=anchor href=#triggering-section>#</a></h3><p>My mother cheating really did &ldquo;mature&rdquo; the family, huh. We stopped having fun with each other despite coming back together after a familial separation that lasted for a week or two, and our goals extended toward the future rather than enjoying the present. Of course, my father proved himself to be particularly intolerant toward our struggles, carrying himself in a manner that indicated that he was only visualizing the problems others caused him and him alone. The fact that I struggled mentally to the point of mental breakdowns that lasted for hours full of screaming, crying, and laughing forced my second-to-youngest brother Peter to be a stonefaced separator between me and my father who often provoked me to tears and then rage. I still ache for what those series of situations did to us, and I&rsquo;m sorry for being weak in such a precarious time. I wish I could have been a better brother. I wish I could have helped them. I wish I could have stopped my father from being such a hateful person and my mother from going through her traumatic childhood and making decisions that only worsened her life and that of her family. I&rsquo;m sorry that I was not perfect enough. I&rsquo;m so sorry. I want to be perfect, and I&rsquo;ll do everything to make sure I become the epitome of grace and beauty. Peter didn&rsquo;t deserve this. Seeing his laugh, smile, and innocent cheer in older videos makes me so frustrated with myself. I want to make it so that we can be happy again, but I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe, it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m unhappy necessarily. I can enjoy myself even now, but I&rsquo;m not content with just letting things be and not doing anything about it. My youngest brother Timothy didn&rsquo;t deserve what he went through. My older half-brother David didn&rsquo;t deserve what he went through. I don&rsquo;t know exactly what my oldest half-brother Kuya Paulo went through, but I know that he is a human being through and through, which necessitates the desire to understand. My half-sister is enigmatic to me, and I want to believe that if she really wants to separate herself from us and treat us in that ignorant way she did without even showing curiosity to understand my siblings and our struggles, then so be it and just go away. Sure, you&rsquo;re a victim in many ways, but you sure do act like your actions don&rsquo;t have an impact. You [my sister] throw around the word &ldquo;mature&rdquo; all the time, and yet, you haven&rsquo;t even done what I believe to be most &ldquo;mature&rdquo; or productive thing to do: always be curious. That&rsquo;s why I have nothing to say because I don&rsquo;t get it anymore, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m trying to study and learn and organize my self because I&rsquo;m trying my best to be a good person. If I&rsquo;m just a horrible person, then someone kill me because I have so much self-will or willpower that it will be hard for me to feel depressed and suicidal again. I have learned that the best way to help is to learn how to help others, and I cannot force others to change, which means I have to change myself. Changing myself requires willpower, and that&rsquo;s my rationale and why it&rsquo;s so easy for me to do things because of the beauty, the goodness, the people, and how frustrated I am with The Suffering. In the end, my life is meaningless because I am not perfect. If I was perfect, I would be able to comprehend everything, but I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m just so weak. I&rsquo;m so futile in many ways, but even then, I have to keep going. I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s all meaningless. Right now, I&rsquo;m motivated, and I will do my best to help my siblings. I will do my best to become perfect. I will do my hardest to break myself if it means I can understand the world and things around me. I cannot be complacent. Never! I just can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s impossible for me not to feel like the only thing left is to move forward. This is it. This is my life.</p><p>A better brother instead of just standing still like a fucking piece of loser shit because I was so confused and trusted people. I will murder if it means I can help my siblings. I will do everything to help them grow and become free from me and my wickedness, my stupidity, my nonsense, and everything that I am which is disgusting and horrible. In the end, my siblings didn&rsquo;t deserve it. No one deserves all the shit they go through, but I get angry, you know, at certain people. I know that if I was a psychopath who only did the right thing without being held back by emotions, then maybe things could be better. However, when I see something beautiful, I wish I could process it as well. I want to be able to comprehend and process it without going crazy. When I try to appreciate the rain, I don&rsquo;t want to go crazy because of how byzantine everything is. I want to understand everything, so I can look at things without going crazy. I need to process the beautiful things. I want to process how valuable a person is even if it will be a very, very partial understanding of them. I want to try. It&rsquo;s so beautiful you know.</p><p>I will become everything, so I can look at person and see them with everything that they are—beautiful and full of life, the complexities that make up a human and that which I will never understand.</p><p>I associate &ldquo;invaliding who I am&rdquo; with getting rid of everything that makes me, including my desire to help others.</p><h3 id=roblox>Roblox
<a class=anchor href=#roblox>#</a></h3><p>I just realized that around 2011–14 Roblox was a pretty community-based game that didn&rsquo;t really require &ldquo;Youtubers&rdquo; to tie it together. There were figures like &ldquo;Telemon&rdquo; and game developers that acted as those figures maybe, but in general, the company Roblox was pretty community-centered. It&rsquo;s only recently in 2016 when the first remarkable sign of change toward appealing to investors began. The addition of the more realistic, less blocky avatar &ldquo;Rthro&rdquo; at this time was a ongoing response to the rise of games like &ldquo;Fortnite,&rdquo; which was released in 2017 but did add fuel to the flame. Now, Roblox acts like the notorious Corporation and older players were soon alienated in favor of a excessively detached and kid-friendly brand, which was reflected in the borderline silent interactions between players in the games. Important to mention, the inclusion of game engine updates that made older &ldquo;experiences&rdquo; or games defunct was a significant contributor to game developer–player alienation since most players who played games regularly often developed their own private games as well. Naturally, Roblox made the right choice in focusing on the next generation, but certain decisions might have been better executed with much less unintended consequences.</p><p>It&rsquo;s crucial to note that around the time that Fortnite was released and Roblox was making gains in adopting a more kid-friendly brand, the &ldquo;Youtube Adpocalypse&rdquo; which many attribute to the mention of a racist slur by the biggest Youtuber at the time, &ldquo;Pewdiepie,&rdquo; along with many other Youtubers who posted &ldquo;edgy content,&rdquo; happened, marking an Internet-wide consensus that the &ldquo;Newsgrounds&rdquo; edgy and early Internet way of doing things was impossible in the current globo-cultural landscape.</p><p>To go further in depth, as of 2010, concerns regarding the changing communal landscape.</p><p>Based on an old video (titled &ldquo;Nerf vulcan ebf-25 testing&rdquo;, made on Feb 4, 2011 \hyperref{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQlPHubS6sI}) by my friend Ram on his Youtube channel Fried price (@SuperRamonino), I learned that I might have been friends with him at 2013, maybe even 2011.</p><p>Around 2013, I was probably already playing Roblox with JM.</p><p>I might have played as a &ldquo;Guest&rdquo; for a while before I finally created a Roblox account.</p><p>I&rsquo;m so different from my 2017 self and the way I expressed myself.</p><p>I remember the defunct blue dialogue thing in Roblox.</p><p>RoastedFisherprice, the username of Ram on Roblox.</p><p>I remember the old Roblox ads where it was just be a fake friend request from the user &ldquo;Telemon.&rdquo; The one I saw from Ram&rsquo;s video (\hyperref{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7Kre8hhPLc&amp;ab_channel=Friedprice}) was on December 13, 2012.</p><p>I remember when I heard of homeopathic remedy when Ram recounted his experience of his mother wetting his shoulders with urine or something.</p><p>I remember when I went to a church for a morning prayer (probably my first) with Tita Maris, Jeremiah, and maybe Kuya Mike. I remember that as we were heading to the car, a woman went to her and said that her dress was demonic or something. Like the Spirit was telling her that it was demonic based on how it looked like.</p><p>I was like &ldquo;Hmm, interesting,&rdquo; because Tita Maris was the gateway to the speaking in tongues kind of church activity.</p><p>I remember the stance of my former main church toward speaking in tongues was that of &ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo; I think I remember hearing some even saying that it was downright demonic. Though, I remember Kuya Arnold, who was a friend and a former member of the main church, might have told me that speaking in tongues was not necessarily bad.</p><p>I saw the old show &ldquo;Maisie Mouse&rdquo; and felt that the characters looked familiar together.</p><p>I remember playing Beyblades and Pogs (Milk caps) in NCA.</p><p>I remember our computer mouses having balls.</p><p>I remember seeing &ldquo;The Busy World of Richard Scarry&rdquo; either by seeing it at a store, owning a book of it, or, least likely, seeing the show.</p><p>I remember seeing the Ronald McDonald sitting on a bench statue.</p><p>I remember seeing a &ldquo;Baby Tumbles Surprise&rdquo; toy in the storage at my former main church, and I remember the youth playing with it a few times, throwing it among other things.</p><p>I remember seeing the old Youtube layout playing Christian music videos with lyrics. I remember the old-looking lyrics design for the video.</p><p>I think I remember seeing a toy from the TV Series &ldquo;Zoids.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s crazy that Robin Williams died so long ago at August 11, 2014. When I heard about it and how it happened, my heart stopped. It still feels new to me now at 2023-08-04 20:25:54.</p><p>I think I remember hearing about former Pastora Malou owning a &ldquo;Blackberry&rdquo; phone. I even remembering typing on one before probably from someone else. I felt like it was high-tech and elegant.</p><p>I remember coin-operated rides.</p><p>I remember seeing action figures all the time.</p><p>I remember when I awkwardly bought a packaged cooked meal from 7-Eleven while with Jeremiah. I remember being the only one who bought it. I think I remember Kuya Mike staring at me in that certain, intolerant manner since I wanted a full meal rather than only junkfood maybe.</p><p>Looking back, 2016 was such a new year since it was also the year of &ldquo;Pokémon GO.&rdquo;</p><p>I&rsquo;m starting to think I got quite unfortunate.</p><p>I was raised homeschool after stopping at around second grade in elementary, but I had a lot of time to go outside, go to events, meet people, and hang out with people in various churches. I learned a lot, but when I finally attended school in 2017, things went by too fast and many traumatic life events happened in 2018. I quit school, and now, it&rsquo;s 2023 where I feel like time has passed too fast because of what I went through. I guess I had to forget the past in order to move on, but 5 years of trying to move on is a lot. I learned a lot during these five years, but I also forgot a lot of memories because it hurt to remember those events.</p><p>eureeka&rsquo;s castle

I think I inspired Timothy to make some.</p><p>I remember coloring books and sticky collection books.</p><p>I remember using pin-back buttons so much and being scared of it a few times. I even worried regarding the fact that it might break my shirt.</p><p>I remember eating the Ministop meals.</p><p>I found an old account in a MMORPG flash game called &ldquo;AdventurerQuest&rdquo; made by Atrix Entertainment. My username is samuel7yr, and I found that the email was the same old email. I accidentally reset the password before trying old passwords to log in in order to confirm whether the passwords I used overtime remained largely the same. I learned that I created the account on Tuesday, January 19, 2010. It was the last date the account was active, so that means that I created the account, logged out, and probably created a different account.</p><p>Apparently, I created the account, but I don&rsquo;t have a character, or maybe they auto-deleted it.</p><p>That&rsquo;s interesting because AdventurerQuest was new to me at the time, which means I did have a complex life before 2010.</p><p>I remember the scary feeling of riding a jeepney up a starkly sloping road in a mountainous area.</p><p>I remember a specific smell while I was happily chatting with Timothy across a door while I was inside a bathroom. Maybe the cheery sound of my voice echoing in the bathroom coupled with the muffled sound of my younger brother mnemonically caused me to remember the smell.</p><p>2006 is the release year of Roblox, and I was born on 2003, which would mean I would be 3 if I played it at that time. Most likely, I started playing at 2009, 2010, 2011, or 2012. Less likely, it could have been 2008 or 2013 as well.</p><p>I remember imagining a black ghostlike humanoid probably with a gas mask–shaped growth where the mouth would be a few times when I was scared of closing my eyes in the shower. I remember it because that was the only time I had any experience with this.</p><p>We use the Philippine personal care brand &ldquo;Human Nature.&rdquo;</p><p>After playing the real-time strategy video game &ldquo;Stronghold Crusader&rdquo; again after many years, as of writing (2023-08-05 19:19:55), I feel empty even after starting a campaign and playing for ten minutes.</p><p>I remember when I played Stronghold Crusader with my siblings and probably friends like Badjoy too in Local area network (LAN) multiplayer.</p><p>Knowing that the anime Redo of Healer was something that happened 2 years ago as of writing (2023-08-05 19:46:00) is bewildering.</p><p>I remember the teaching of Brother Sadhu of this story where a person lay down and meditated, and then they met Jesus or an angel I think. He has told numerous stories of either him or others meeting Jesus Christ while meditating in the Spirit or something. People liked him because he was so charismatic and confident, casual enough to make jokes but serious enough to state things like &ldquo;There is an angel in this place right now&rdquo; while holding a prayer that spanned across the whole Araneta Coliseum.</p><p>I remember lying down on the floor many times in many places: on the bathroom floor, on the kitchen floor, on the living room floor, on the balcony, under the double deck bed, under the master bed where my mother and father slept. These two beds are gone for years now.</p><p>I remember thinking many times that the doorbell of our house had a cool symbol when we first moved to this house. I remember seeing other houses&rsquo; doorbells and thinking the texture, the symbol, and function were cool and sophisticated probably because in our old house, such an appliance was absent.</p><p>I remember recognizing that the door chime cover of our house looked like a &ldquo;Lego&rdquo; brick. Now that I look at it, it could also be called a &ldquo;Roblox&rdquo;-looking brick.</p><p>After over a decade, I learned that the black clips from NCA were called steel binder clips. I might have overheard the name from a teacher but ignored it.</p><p>I remember when this American person went to NCA. I remember that he said that he had the talent of being able to play trumpet with his mouth. He would grab a pen, pretend it was a trumpet, and begin to make trumpet sounds with his mouth. Some of my classmates might have found it lame.</p><p>I remember going on various field trips in NCA, but I forgot. I might have been able to go on a special field trip to Mcdonald&rsquo;s because I was &ldquo;Privilege E,&rdquo; which meant that I performed exceptionally I think.</p><p>I remember that in my school days, I saw my MCA classmate Juan Gutierrez playing chess with another classmate, Neo Bregente. I remember them sitting down next to the foot of the staircase leading to the next floor. They were sitting a meter or two meters away from the entranceway that led to a staircase to a lower floor. The floor where the two classmates sat, squatted, or both included a lobby, the pastor&rsquo;s office, the roll call area which could be considered equal to the lobby, the church area, and the room wherein I would repeat mantras or manifestation statements along with representatives from other grades and classrooms and wherein I remember late Teacher Alvin holding a math class there. I remember that in this math class, I saw Lauren struggling to understand the math. This calmed me down since I struggle to understand it either. Seeing Aidan, who was there as well, seem to understand it well worried me I think.</p><p>I remember how I would often do hand clapping games with my classmates in NCA. This one clapping game I remember included mentions of various Filipino leaders such as Jose Risal and &ldquo;Gloria&rdquo; who most likely referred to &ldquo;Maria Gloria Macaraeg Macapagal Arroyo.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember the many late nights of riding a bus with my mother. Many times, I would be riding with the youth as well. I remember riding a bus many times with my whole family to many far away places, especially Quezon. I remember the feeling of heading to Quezon and watching the various landmarks, especially the grave yard that meant I was already in the Municipality of Candelaria, one of the administrative divisions of Quezon City. Candelaria means &ldquo;Candle,&rdquo; so the simple name trend, to which the area of &ldquo;Soldiers&rdquo; or &ldquo;Soldiers&rsquo; Hills&rdquo; adhered, extended here.</p><p>I remember that James Josh&rsquo;s relatives live in Lucena. I would always hear the word &ldquo;Lucena,&rdquo; but I only learned now that Lucena was a provincial capital municipality.</p><p>I remember traveling through South Luzon Expressway many times, and it&rsquo;s only recently when the skyway was built that I got to experience what it&rsquo;s like to go very quickly. Of course, travel time was often irregular even after we got a car. I remember spending many hours in traffic and being in the same car as my siblings. It&rsquo;s rare now that all of us are in the same car, but we used to fit ourselves forcibly into it. It was fun, but definitely, I prefer the space though along with the delegation of responsibilities through the facilitation of various tools, which enabled self-improvement but also the potentiality of self-destructive behavior.</p><p>I remember the many days of sitting down in the bus and waiting for the bus to start. I would always a leap of joy when the bus finally moved. I remember the feeling of staring outside at the manifold people flocking about. It was like seeing doves taking flight or dogs moving along in a highway. I remember the feeling of getting enraptured by the various street lights and their visual impact on the multivariate objects and people standing or moving about, each with an expression that I identified simply and tried to study within the short time frame in which their existences were registered within my comprehension. I remember the feeling of each step on the road multiplying to tens up to over a hundred people pushing and pulling themselves up the buses gathered in various rotations. I remember the feeling of the sky being partially obstructed with smoke from the buses and the open grills. I remember the way each billboard added shape to an otherwise messy landscape. I remember the way each person&rsquo;s voice felt subdued and the way each person stood felt like they were stuck in a jail cell waiting to pounce outside. Those who felt comfortable were usually sleeping. I remember the way the window felt. Pressing against it was like pressing against wood while adopting an awkward, aching posture. I remember the feeling of pressing myself left, right, side to side, and up and down to get a feel for the seat and see if I could comfort myself despite the sense of inertia. I remember the angelic sound of the buses, as if they were loud trumpets awaiting the call of heaven. This angelic feeling only occurred when I was finally out of the bus after hours of waiting and sitting on the bus as it trolled about in curves, straight roads, and various intersections. It was rare to experience a roundabout in a bus, and if I did, it was usually during a school fieldtrip where we would go to a place that accommodated large amounts of people. I remember the feeling of riding a jeepney back home from Festival Mall through the roundabout and around several curves. I remember the feeling of going to school and seeing the various expressions of various students. Often, I would see students combing their hair or staying tensely or languidly still like a turtle.</p><p>I remember seeing the many faces of people sitting at the back of the bus and the way former Pastor Sierra would share a verse while standing on the isle. We were probably on the way to the destination of a church outing.</p><p>I remeber Teacher Noreen possibly talking to us and my classmates regarding a field trip and what to do. I think I remember that the teachers separated students of different grades into separate buses. The buses were rented of course. If I remember correctly, the church rented a bus once as well probably for something other than a school outing. I remember going on many field trips on a bus distinct from the buses owned by the government of Muntinlupa.</p><p>It was only when I was in MCA that I got to experience riding a bus in a government-owned bus.</p><p>I remember talking to various people while sitting down. I remember listening to hundreds of people, getting an experience like an interview restrained from the stereotypical questions one would find boring and quite monotonous. More importantly, having a casual encounter in a random environent with an interested open-minded listener was a good trigger for honesty and a reliable interview.</p><p>I remember the many streets in the dirtier part of wealthier commercial urban settings that loosely reminded me of the alleyways I often saw in American films. The municipality where I was born, including the poorer, open neighborhoods and the close-gated neighborhoods, felt less restricted compareed to the structural grays and neatly shaped infrastructure of the wealthier commercial places.</p><p>The most verdantly planted place I knew was Quezon City of course, but since the Internet there was bad, I always assumed it to be an extreme opposite end of the socio-cultural and structural limitations of a place like Bonifacio Global City (BGC).</p><p>I&rsquo;ve read many posts on Facebook who saw the city where I lived in the same manner that I saw BGC. I bet they would be socio-culturally stunned if they experienced BGC like I did.</p><p>I remember the feeling of waking up sweating in bed, sickly.</p><p>I was only an adolescent, yet I was full of visual memories. Nevertheless, I only knew as much about introspection and regard for my existence as much as I knew about what a dog was—a friendly and sometimes rabid animal that people adopt, which is a rather quick and limited description compared to the myriad advanced textbooks that could take years to study.</p><p>I knew what murder was, and I heard about it. I heard about fears, and I also developed my limited understanding of it. I studied time and time again the interplay of tragic, traumatic events and human character through sermons, films, art, music, the Bible, performances, and people, among many others. Yet, experiencing tragedy myself was like touching fire for the first time. The ideas and ideals of a perfect, powerful man became absolved in the presence of such a powerful presence of something simple as a burning finger. I remember the feeling of realizing that my traumatic, tragic years were the worst part rather than the ultimate executive events that decided things forever and finalized the effects of those years of struggle against sin, the tyrannical authority of my father and the enabling and neglect of my mother, the intergroup conflict within my family under the projected frustration of our eldest brother and eldest sister, and the bumpy interrelations between Christian members.</p><p>I remember the sight of hundreds of people gathering together in a group to pray. I remember the serious, respectful expressions on their young faces compared to the almost feverish expressions of the older members on Tita Maris&rsquo; side of Protestantism.</p><p>I remember the smile of an older man standing at another pew oir chair as he nodded toward me when the person speaking at the front or podium said that we should greet one another in some phrase expressing their best wishes. This was common within a church setting from my experience.</p><p>I remember the feeling of seeing a bright sun outside and the way it reflected on the curtains made me feel like I was about to die due to the almost biblical way that my life was. It was as if I was living a movie only found in films and discussions on social media. I felt like I was living a life that only one would live in a first world country. That curtain that blocked all light was incredibly luxurious even for me, and the fact that I was able to buy from &ldquo;Ikea&rdquo; was incredibly disorienting because of how far in terms of standards of living my family has come due to financial mobility. The fact that people in Western countries consider the clothing company &ldquo;H&amp;M&rdquo; to be cheap was one of the most confusing feelings I&rsquo;ve felt. I always associated the West with another world like the fantasy world in an &ldquo;isekai&rdquo; story. When I first bought H&amp;M for myself rather than for an event, I felt like I was the richest person in the world. I remember the feeling of going to a restaurant for myself rather than for an event and the feeling of going to a cafe for myself rather than for an event. I remember the feeling of going to camp, which costed 1,000 pesos usually. That was the most expensive thing in the world to me. So when we bought &ldquo;Minecraft&rdquo; for 20 dollars, it was like the end of the world, and I might have promised to make use of it as much as possible. I remember the feeling of buying anything from anywhere and being content with things that costed only 5 pesos and thinking that 20 pesos was extravagant.</p><p>The sudden, intrusive thought of my desire to talk about how poor I used to be and how awkward that is to say make me want to imitate verbally the older adults who repeated to me concerning wasting food and money. This is partly because my cousin Jeremiah probably would consider himself quite normal because he was very sheltered relative to me. I realize that being really sheltered meant ignorance of how wealthy or first world one was. Yet, many years ago, I learned that contentment and happiness could become out of reach for those in such wealthy living conditions, which left me confused and curious. Of course, the vulnerability that arose from my ignorance of the complexity which hid behind textbooks and years of exposure to multifarious firsthand struggles and joys within specifically configured environments, limitations, and instances of ignorance and socio-cultural arrangements and which comprised of people in relation to the world made me more sensitive to peoples&rsquo; insults and disparaging tone and wording at the time.</p><p>When I realized many times over with increasing complexity just how much people spend on many things especially considering the loose connection between Jeremiah&rsquo;s wealthy family&rsquo;s spending and the first-world depictions of America in films and various shows, a confusion began to take root and persists until today as of writing (2023-08-07 01:30:25). Knowing that 1,000 pesos is enough to give a child schooling at a very low-quality public school made me feel strange. Combined with the fact that I spent probably around 250 pesos going to Starbucks, drinking a coffee, and going back home on many occasions, I felt stranger. Even more so, now that I remember the depth of money that someone like Jeremiah spent everyday made me wonder. I remember the first time I saw his mother give him 1,000 pesos for lunch. Of course, he saved the rest of the money, but that made me just stare and maintain composure at how weird our human lives were in relation to the suffering of the rest of humanity behind the shelters of our homes. Of course, saying all this is hard because more often than not, people on the Internet scrolling through certain shorts are people who would find what I say disagreeble because they are the people who have the advantage and the subsequent firsthand ignorance of the sufferings people faced. In the end, it&rsquo;s better that people&rsquo;s lives are better, yet many people&rsquo;s lives are compromised and pushed out of sight for those languid rich people to maintain comfort despite the great divide in wealth. The fact that everyone focuses on America due to the wealth of voices that they are able to muster due to easy access to many normalized necessities of which billions of people outside the US are bereft makes me gives me a feeling of inferiority regarding which humans gain the benefit of increased value over the others. This feeling is shared by many other nations who look to the US through films and their great superpower state. The exaggeration of victimhood which many US citizens display on the Internet constantly and their constant dismissiveness of human beings from other countries contributes to worldwide reverence and revilement. Of course, this could be attributed to having so much power but being too ignorant to use it effectively, resulting in &ldquo;blindfolded&rdquo; bloodshed. It&rsquo;s funny because the symbol of being blindfolded is seen in Lady Justice.</p><p>In the end, my concerns largely lack the substance which a victim of a certain appearance would exude naturally and by default. Power is monopolized, which symbolically contrasts with the ideal of competition within capitalism.</p><p>An ineffective oversimplistic way of looking at an issue is that my siblings have begun to become complacent in their middle class wealth, opting to play video games instead of trying to maximize their growth like a complacent person in a privileged position would in contrast to the spiritual, psychological, and financial desperation of those in developing country poverty. Of course, a more productive and curious answer would be that they lack exposure to knowledge that would bring them to the same understanding and motivations that I have and that forcing them to adhere to a certain job or line of jobs is only going to maximize suffering and guilt. Dreams make up the fabric of good will because they are focused on human production rather than sequential programmed behavior that arises out of compulsion in self-worthlessness. Knowing that you&rsquo;re an irreplaceable singular whole made up of factors is crucial to empathizing with those in lack and determining how effectively you will embue them with agency.</p><p>But I remain optimistic regarding the direction of America and its impact on my life, which naturally includes everything and everyone that I know, because I predict that any further sustained pessimism will only return me back to depression and self-destructive behavior.</p><p>What I said is reflective of the extent of my concerns and hereinafter comes the writing detailing in a tone that regards the magnitude of my optimism and the potentiality for a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the issues at hand.</p><p>In the end, TLDR, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on, and I&rsquo;m voicing out my concerns within the great limits of my perspective. This is one way to acknowledge both the complexity of the world and the the complexity of my life. There&rsquo;s also the concern between the ideals and outcome and why I trust human ingenuity even if we could die any moment now.</p><p>I remember what it felt like to look at the street down below from the window at the bottom of the staircase that led to the lower floor of MCA.</p><p>I remember the feeling of wearing a green shirt for some event at MCA.</p><p>My father would often quote to my mother Numbers 6:24-26 from what I believe to be the New International Version of the Bible: &ldquo;The LORD bless you and keep you; the LORD make his face shine on you and be gracious to you; the LORD turn his face toward you and give you peace.&rdquo;</p><p>I and my siblings would also do the sequence of &ldquo;putting on the Armor of God.&rdquo;</p><p>I should make a book regarding the creation of units on Roblox. I should make videos regarding my creation of Roblox games.</p><p>I remember when I lied to my sister regarding watching Riverdale. My mind accidentally went and responded to her question regarding whether I watched Riverdale with a &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Because she looked enthusiastic, I struggled and failed to tell her that it was a lie.</p><p>Because I&rsquo;m afraid of being that stressed, toxic older brother, I avoid pointing out things my siblings do that look weird to me and things that affect me like when my younger brother Peter opens the curtains and wakes me up in the morning before I was able to get 8 hours of sleep.</p><p>I remember when the former youth member Desiree Evali saying that a guy walking on the road was too handsome that he shouldn&rsquo;t be walking on the road in the hot tropical sun because it would be a waste or &ldquo;sayang.&rdquo; We were on a jeep traveling on a road I only went several times to an event of the church networks.</p><p>We grew up eating home cooked food rather than fast food. I considered fast food to be luxurious, which was why going to fast food restaurants only on birthdays was enjoyable. The fact that people become obese due to eating fast food will always be a cultural anomaly to me because I used to be a very big eater for home cooked food and I stayed at a healthy weight throughout my life. Seeing my classmates at school interacting and participating in sports with such healthy proprioceptive expressions furthered that divide between my country and a place infamous for a higher distribution of obesity like America. Yet, I can accept the idea of someone being obese once I saw such a person, but the public transportation in jeepneys would probably want to charge an obese person multiple times the standard price but are restricted by law because the jeepney only comprises of two long seats with prospective passengers trying to sit in between the seated passengers and any amount of space one takes via bringing along things like large items or equipment makes people glance and assign a certain level of responsibility to that person. It is natural for already struggling jeepney drivers to want to get as much passengers as possible.</p><p>I would often hear them guiding new entering passengers toward a seat in between the other passengers. Sometimes, the driver made a bad call by thinking there was still space enough space for a new passenger.</p><p>I remember acting a certain way in public many times as part of a personal experiment to see how people react to my weird, suspicious, confident, and hiding body language. It was an acting experiment, yet it worked because people&rsquo;s expressions and face and bodily expressions changed in response to me. They paid me a certain amount of attention because of the way I carried myself. Now that I look back, people do care a lot about using their &ldquo;vibe check,&rdquo; &ldquo;gaydar,&rdquo; and &ldquo;body language expertise&rdquo; to conclude the nature of someone through body language, or behavioralism. Of course, most likely, they became curious rather than judgmental.</p><p>I remember of going to the SM Putatan many, many times and staying there for hours as I read a book, wrote down on my mother&rsquo;s notebook, studied people&rsquo;s behavior, or a combination of these while I waited for my mother to finish her devotions or meeting with a party. This experience was one of many that reflected how close I was to my mother and the outside world compared to my younger siblings.</p><p>I remember when we were taught by the former youth church member David La Madrid teaching me and the other youth about singing for a choir. I remember when Kuya David was confused when he noticed that I was struggling to sing certain notes. He said that he was confused because he thought me to be tenor. I remember that Tita Nhora delegated music-related tasks to David.</p><p>I remember when we did an egg hunt at my former main church many times and I think they said that the house of the family of the pastor, which was located at the church, was off limits, including the bathrooms.</p><p>I remember when my siblings and I ran together whenever we would go to NCA I think.</p><p>I remember when I would go hang out with JM, and since JM was friends with GB, we would go to GB&rsquo;s house and go to basketball with GB from time to time. It was hard to relate to GB since he played console games rather than the PC games I played. He had the same personality regarding others like his older brother, Aaron: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my problem.&rdquo; The statement itself is fine, but it is the fact they needed to mention that was strange since it&rsquo;s easy to let people know through body language instead of saying something that could be interpreted as sheltered or spoiled. I remember when I heard Aaron say that while walking on the sidewalk by the gas station next to the foot of the road that led to the subdivision where I lived. Additionally, GB had a problem when people failed to answer him in short order during a three-way conversation, which made him harder to interact with. At least, Aaron was more willing to hang out at church. Now, I realize that people like GB, Aaron, and Peter who often say things directly while having a simple body language bereft of expression are those who struggle to communicate via body language and tone which is essential in navigating through complex issues and avoiding insulting someone by accident. Charisma is often rooted in how well you can express yourself and get your message across effectively which differs notably from &ldquo;saying thing directly.&rdquo;</p><p>I deleted the history of my Facebook Messenger conversations with many people which impairs my ability to document.</p><p>I notice that often, I have delay of about five seconds before I process a joke and laugh enough that Kuya Glenn joked about it one time. I remember at that time, Kuya Glenn was at a corner next to the kitchen table and railings of the staircase. I remember him doing a hand signal regarding the delay.</p><p>Kuya Paulo was the kind of person to have Trafalgar Law and Fairytail characters in his profile picture on Facebook.</p><p>I remember the smell of the condo of the house of Tita Steph. I remember when we went there to eat. I remember the phones with keyboard keys, probably Samsung.</p><p>I think I remember seeing tablets and phones like Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, which was released on June 8, 2011.</p><p>We had a book called &ldquo;Martha Calling.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember when David scammed people in an online video game called &ldquo;Stick Run,&rdquo; a former Facebook game notorious for trading in-game items and scams. I remember when David used the website builder platform &ldquo;Weebly&rdquo; to host a fake way to get the &ldquo;Robux&rdquo; currency of the online game-sharing platform &ldquo;Roblox,&rdquo; which uses their built-in game engine. It was meant to scam those who wanted Robux by making them type their username and password into a &ldquo;textbox input&rdquo; near a line of text which claimed that it would grant them a multiplicity of Robux if they put in their private information to accept the Robux offer.</p><p>I remember abiding by a rule where I refrained from going into &ldquo;Creative Mode&rdquo; in the video game &ldquo;Minecraft&rdquo; in order to ensure an immersive playing experience and to refrain from abusing my power as a Twitch streamer who managed the Minecraft server meant for viewers and as a moderator who managed the Minecraft server and the Discord server which I created for the frequent viewers and players of the Minecraft server.</p><p>I remember when I brought my youngest brother Timothy to the restaurant &ldquo;Yellow Cab&rdquo; and telling him that I was going against my values by bringing him to eat pizza which is unhealthy food. I remember the feeling of passing by many people in the streets and seeing two passing girls wave their hair in my direction while locking eyes with me.</p><p>I remember the sharp saliva sounds whenever I would smack my lips in the morning probably because my mouth was drier than usual while I slept. It was a frequent enough occurrence that the sound imparts faint images of more nuanced and complex memories associated with waking up in various locations such as camps and church where I would hear those distinct sounds within my mouth and close to my ear.</p><p>Whenever I wake up and try to enhance the velocity of the force which my body produces during walking motion, my body undergoes a series of movements wherein my lower limbs focus on lifting my legs but struggle to do so smoothly. My legs quickly regain the advantage of smooth movement once the connection between internal thought and the memories within the related muscle are re-established, which occurs in short enough order to be a trivial sequence of awakening. A combination of the subsequent exhaustion of deep thought during the &ldquo;half-dream, half-conscious&rdquo; stage of awakening, an urge to hurry one&rsquo;s movements during the standing up portion of awakening, traversing a staircase, the stepped design of which immediately engages the muscles which walking through flat ground fails to address in strong form, the holding of valued objects which command care, and the cumulative pressure of the balancing act usually account for this sequence of awakening.</p><p>Recounting each stretch I do on a day-to-day basis proffers a challenge through the complex processes of stretching which I have integrated into average functioning until my brain dismisses its occurrence and even refrains from memorizing thoroughly the satisfaction and relief which stretching derives.</p><p>I remember the memory of reading the webnovel &ldquo;Chrysalis,&rdquo; especially the scene with the lizard and the scene with the snail.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve seen many kinds of drinking containers in my life, including the porcelain teacup, stoneware coffee mug, crystal stemware, acrylic tumbler, copper Moscow Mule mug, glass highball tumbler, ceramic latte bowl, enameled camping cup, bamboo fiber travel mug, tulip-shaped beer glass, Japanese matcha bowl (chawan), stackable plastic water tumbler, and mason jar drinking mug.</p><p>I remember when at NCA, I and my classmates, despite how serious the teachers made singing the national anthem &ldquo;Lupang Hinirang&rdquo; of our country, the Philippines, I would often encounter or maybe even take apart in singing that suggested an underlying tone of humor in regard to the way we orderly stood together, put our hands on our chest, and sang despite our frequent incapacities to sing skillfully. I think I remember my classmates, especially Clarence I think, even shouting in a somewhat hoarse voice at times. I think the principal often sternly warned us regarding such behavior.</p><p>I remember the feeling of hiding behind the plants by the side of the chapel at NCA at a period when those plants were large enough where a person could hide. I remember when I would go home, walking alongside various people from time to time. I probably walked alongside my classmates, but I think I would often see my classmates ride vehicles going home and going to school. I remember the feeling of people running to get to school when they were late and seeing them enter the classroom with a worried look on their face. Naturally, I think they were warned sternly for being late. I remember the feeling of talking with classmates and former main church members there behind the chapel past the red gate at the front of the school. The red gate was located inside past and at the right side of the main black gate. I remember when I climbed the red gate and hung on it when I was much smaller. I think I got reprimanded and that was during church hours.</p><p>I remember hanging around and watching people do their thing as a child. I remember observing others and sitting down on a pew. I remember that I would be quite silent for a child since I was pretty introverted. I remember playing with others though. I remember the feeling of playing lots of children&rsquo;s games that we made up to pass the time. They look nonsensical now that I think about it, but to us, that was how we found ourselves passing the time.</p><p>I remember the emotions of fun and appreciation toward certain games we made up.</p><p>I remember the profound feeling of staring past the fence barrier of my high-ground village. I was inside the village on the road in front of the primary entrance of my main church. Looking at the way the blue sky seemed to meet the ground visually behind the fence barrier into space. This ground includes the buildings and the street outside which were all much on much lower ground than the village.</p><p>I remember writing many stories badly, but I had the vivid imagination that even if my wording was obscure, they triggered the fountain of emotions and ideas associated with certain fantasy narratives which I imagined. I remember the story I wrote regarding a bandit. I remember the fight between a group of bandits and a group of government forces. I remember the story that included village houses lined up together as the villagers hid during a foreign incursion.</p><p>I remember staring off into the house next to the church grounds. I remember the house on the other side of the road in front of the church.</p><p>I remember watching episode 105 of the anime &ldquo;One Piece.&rdquo; It was daytime, and I think I was relaxing, doing something else in the meantime. Additionally, the episode was a filler which might explain the relaxed mood.</p><p>I remember when I saw my oldest half-brother Kuya Paulo watching the &ldquo;Punk Hazard Arc&rdquo; of One Piece on a computer on an illegal website, which was probably the anime-focused file streaming website &ldquo;Kissanime.&rdquo; I remember seeing the kid characters and the antagonist &ldquo;Caesar Clown.&rdquo; For clarity, the punk hazard arc, according to the One Piece &ldquo;Fandom&rdquo; website, occurred between epsisode 579 - 589 and 591 - 625, totaling 46 episodes.</p><p>I remember the length feeling of being able to reach episode 105 and feeling very relaxed and accomplished probably because it was a way to celebrate a long day of working on something probably.</p><p>I remember the numerous psychotraumatic moments I&rsquo;ve had throughout my life.</p><p>If my whole life was recorded with all my crying and shouting, maybe I&rsquo;d feel like my life was more than just a memory.</p><p>When I started watching One Piece, I was expecting to see the part where I remembered that scene. I repeatedly reinforced this scene into my memory while watching One Piece because I was curious and it was a chronological frame of reference.</p><p>I remember</p><p>Talk about Robotics.</p><p>Talk about the feeling of someone pointing at you.</p><p>I remember buying hot pandesal at seven in the morning after heading near &ldquo;Soldiers Hills&rdquo;. I remember that I rarely ate the pandesal on the way home and usually waited until I arrived home. When I did get a taste on the way home instead of waiting, it was hotter and subsequently more delicious. I remember expressing my appreciation in my mind every time I bit and tasted the buttery taste.</p><p>I experience profound ecstasy and disapointment in myself whenever I suddenly feel an profound appreciation for a piece of art or experience. The disappointment stems from my ability to overlook the beauty of the world and experiences and the beauty of art.</p><p>I want to talk about the beauty of anything because I have a lot of experiences. However, listing them down is probably the best for now with some exceptions where I try to delineate my profound emotions through each and every one of them.</p><p>The vehicle-flattened cloth on the road used to wipe the insides of jeeps. This colorful cloth comprised of square patches stiched together in more than tens within interconnected layers which form the base.</p><p>The gravel, trash, homeless people lying on cardboard mats, and intermittent square, three-column drainage covers lying on the side of the road. I remember the 6 handles of those drenage covers.</p><p>The sound of the cars passing across horizontal lines.</p><p>The booming of the buses.</p><p>The bumpy sidewalk.</p><p>The very concave intermidiate portion between the road and the sidewalk.</p><p>The layers of concrete sidewalks breaking apart like the sides and edges of eroded cliffs. The mixture between the patterned top layer combined with yellow patterned markings, the rougher and spotty concrete below, and the dirt-mixed third-to-highest layer.</p><p>The pieces of leaves.</p><p>The smooth portion of the sidewalk which signifies the lengthening of the sidewalk due to the act.</p><p>The dirty posts which carry the electricity lines. The bare rectangular portions on the sides tell of the political posters depicting candidates which used to be glued there.</p><p>The numerous ad signages and road signs.</p><p>The holes scattered in the broken layers of concrete and the water that would often create a pond over them.</p><p>The numerous single and double metal holes which used to connect to road signs.</p><p>The messy disparity of gray shades even at gas stations which usually have smoother concrete.</p><p>The black rock–filled gray concrete patches on the ground which is distinct from the blacker asphalt roads.</p><p>The eroded yellow markings.</p><p>The myriad drainage cover designs.</p><p>The concrete sidewalk, which had a design that looked like lines lying side by side very closely together, near the village and at my former main church.</p><p>The gray interspacing the yellow and black of the painted humps.</p><p>The water dispensers usually in a line of twos, threes, and sometimes fours side by side in cafetarias and restaurants in economically disadvantaged linear sectors of town.</p><p>The way the orange street lights messily sectioned through the chaotic electric lines the cluttered textures and fragmentations which reify the lives that occur day in, day out upon this land.</p><p>The vehicles parked together under the elevated highway which is the main expressway that crosses over a bend of the main road.</p><p>The billboard that stood right next to a restaurant where I, my mother, my older half-sister, and my third-to-oldest sibling, who is my older half-brother, ate on the second floor. The distance between it and the restaurant is very short, the restaurant has an open roof, and the billboard looks old and rusty. This combination of factors indicate the shortcomings in either the enforcement of zoning laws or the consideration of such structural conditions during the planning and approval processes.</p><p>I remember when we were swimming during a church outing, JM would be pressing on this mobile application with red and green buttons, each of which made a different &ldquo;meme&rdquo; sound when pressed.</p><p>I saw some similarities between my cousin Jeremiah and my younger brother Peter, but I was the kind of person who believed that everyone knew everything that I knew. So, I felt hurt when people thought I was lying to them because I was so sure that, despite my attempts at hiding myself, everyone knew me as if they could see me as I slept. I lived my life with strong willfulness and a sense of integrity along with rare but significant concomitants of profound guilt, shame, anxiety, and self-hatred. My belief that everyone could see through me accounted for this integrity, and my belief in God and my parents, both of whom I was taught could see through me.</p><p>I remember believing so hard that God saw me that I struggled to sleep at night. It think it was sometimes to the point of psychosis, considering that I was professionally diagnosed with bipolar I disorder with psychotic features. The intense belief that everyone could see through me indicated a delusional pattern of thought.</p><p>My room is probably around 140&rdquo; in length, 125&rdquo; in width, and 100&rdquo; in height.</p><p>Things I say include &ldquo;The Might of Glockwood&rdquo;, something I haven&rsquo;t said in a long time as of writing (August 14, 2023, 12:49 PM).</p><p>Looking at different social media that I don&rsquo;t use for 5 minutes every 6 months really feels like traveling to a new country.</p><p>Getting exposed to the female-dominated side of social media has given me a more nuanced understanding of women and the things they like that some of them rarely talk about in public.</p><p>Whenever I use my phone while lying against a couch, the pinky of my left hand would often go numb.</p><p>I remember when we drank milo at Tita Nhora&rsquo;s and Lola Cecille&rsquo;s house. I remember that Tita Nhora&rsquo;s milo had little sugar. I think I remember drinking milo with little or no sugar at Lola Cecille&rsquo;s house probably by choice.</p><p>I remember feeling proud of my ID picture at MCA and feeling particularly attractive probably due to the way I smiled in the picture.</p><p>I remember the many late nights of riding along with my cousin Jeremiah on the road just outside of the village where he lived. I remember seeing the many stores, restaurants, banks, and bakeries all around.</p><p>I remember the feeling of watching old Youtube. I remember seeing the black sides, which were indicative of dark mode and surrounded the video. I think this image came from when I saw my oldest half-brother Kuya Paulo or my older half-brother David watching the Youtuber &ldquo;Pewdiepie&rdquo;.</p><p>I remember seeing many dogs throughout my life. It was in the movies that I got to see dogs as more human due to many media, especially films such as &ldquo;Beethoven&rdquo; (1992), Cats & Dogs (2001), Marmaduke (2010), Scooby-Doo (2002), Hotel for Dogs (2009), Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004), and the &ldquo;Buddies&rdquo; series.</p><p>I remember watching the film &ldquo;Bird Box&rdquo; in 2018. 2018 felt so new to me due to the fact that I was watching it while most likely feeling distracted by many things at the time. I remember feeling incredibly immersed especially at the ending.</p><p>I remember the feeling of listening to punk rock artists such as YUNGBLUD and Machine Gun Kelly, especially the song &ldquo;I Think I&rsquo;m OKAY&rdquo; which was apparently released on Jun 7, 2019.</p><p>I remember seeing many birds flying above. I remember the feeling of listening to birds even back at the old apartment I think. However, I think I heard the birds less when we moved to the current apartment where I live as of writing (2023-08-16 02:03:47).</p><p>I remember the magical feeling of seeing a squirrel for the first time in real life here in the Philippines where squirrels are introduced rather than native. I was astounded as the countless films I&rsquo;ve watched were suddenly brought upon the real world. It was hurriedly snuffed out by the distraction of the streets and my family around me in the same car. However, I still remember that unique feeling of magic. I know the feeling of magic from many situations and media, but this one was particular in its own right.</p><p>I remember the feeling I got from the weird side of Youtube that included Jack Stauber&rsquo;s music, the animated episodic series &ldquo;Llamas with hats&rdquo;, and Salad Fingers 1: Spoon. Animation short films like &ldquo;Double king&rdquo; by Felix Colgrave and &ldquo;Cat City&rdquo;, &ldquo;Find true love&rdquo;, &ldquo;Kittykat96&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Floatland&rdquo; by the Youtuber &ldquo;vewn&rdquo; gave me a similar but subdued feeling.</p><p>I remember the feeling of floating out into space whenever I would lay down at night in my younger years many years before I moved from downstairs to the room where I am. I might have watched a film, read a book, used my turn at the computer, or a combination of these before I lay down. However, they each gave me the feeling of wonder. It was a different feeling most likely because I had less control over the temperature of the downstairs area where I slept: I live in the Philippines where the nights can be cold and the days can be warm. However, the general temperature often gave me an adventurous feeling. Now that I have my own room and my family has experienced social mobility, turning on the aircon in the room where I sleep now. The fact that I often go outside in the wind under the orange lights of the streets and in the dimly lit inside of the jeepneys. I remember the feeling of the air and the heat and how often they immersed me. I remember the numerous people seated in the jeepneys, which was a reflection of the area wherein a distinct portion of my memories were made.</p><p>I remember sitting down and watching TV, pointing at the various things that occurred in the films. I realize now it was only relatively recent that we had a TV in the current apartment where I am. In our old house, we had an old square TV, but I believe that my parents decided against bringing it. I remember pressing the somewhat squeaky buttons of the TV. I remember the feeling of turning up and down the volume. Years after, seeing media that showed these TVs made me feel that I might have lived a life free from real-life experiences related to them. However, I did have vivid experiences with TVs and the various functions it offered to my youngling brain. I remember that the TV had the antennas, but we chose to watch CDs probably because the antennas were either faulty, my parents disliked the news and the usual TV channels, or both. I think I remember seeing the older news through the TV. I remember one time when my family tried to fix the TV and get it to work on cable by adjusting the antennas.</p><p>It was in this house when my mother threw shoes at me. I remember that I was a bigger child during this time, which meant I had many experiences before that which amounted to that feeling that I was a bigger child.</p><p>I remember the feeling of pressing the buttons of the CD player. I remember the sounds of pressing those buttons and hearing the click sounds of their instances of release. I had a feeling that these electrical appliances were decent rather than state-of-the-art. Of course, now, I think they&rsquo;re old rather than decent.</p><p>I remember entering many older houses with older colors and older electrical appliances besides my grandmother Lola Cecille&rsquo;s house.</p><p>I remember the exposed aggregate concrete which paved the edges of the flat porch of the old apartment. I remember that the porch was mostly covered with mint-colored tiles.</p><p>I remember placing my face underneath the top of the the French Fry cooker which constituted of a cuboid container made from stainless steel or another heat-resistant material where the cooking of French Fries made sizzling sounds. The dimensions of the container range from 26 to 30 inches in length and 10 to 14 inches in thickness. It could have been somewhat curvilinear at the top; however, the sides of it were straight-edged. It only contained two frying meshes or cribriform frying baskets. It was open and accessible on the frontal side, which required some level of protective clothing in order to engage with it. It used analog knobs and switches which allow for manual adjustments to setting temperature and possibly cooking time.</p><p>I remember standing outside and inside the Mcdonald&rsquo;s located at Manila S Rd, Putatan, Muntinlupa, Metro Manila.</p><p>I remember eating there many times, thinking that place was fancy especially since I ate there a few times with my cousin Jeremiah I think.</p><p>I remember feeling like it was the most fancy place I have ever been. I think I remember eating there for a birthday at the second or third floor.</p><p>I remember the various people that stayed there. It felt like I was a part of a crowd of people that lasted for centuries at times. It feels now that it would take centuries for me to feel this feeling that I was part of a group from a tribehood from the long gone past.</p><p>I remember the numerous occasions and lives that passed. Each time I went there to that Mcdonald&rsquo;s coincided with other experiences part of successively new periods and new lives, each carrying great meaning for the consequences that lay ahead up to today.</p><p>I remember the feeling of walking past the cars and standing outside, seeing members of my former main church. I probably remember seeing classmates from NCA who went to this fancy Mcdonald&rsquo;s restaurant.</p><p>I remember the feeling of meeting hundreds of people here. I remember when the ice cream stall first appeared. I remember eating ice cream many times there and thinking that the Mcflurry tasted good.</p><p>I remember the feeling of a congregation of people walking through the streets. I remember the feeling that we were part of a bigger world and the gigantic world that I had in the old apartment was only a small bubble. Now, how many worlds have I conquered?</p><p>I remember the feeling of walking down the street on the side of Arkishop and stepping over this large block of stone on many occasions. This block was a part of the sidewalk for some reason. I remember when I went into the hospital next to Arkishop to get my bleeding forehead fixd. This hospital, for some reason, seems to be defunct now.</p><p>I remember the feeling of walking down the probably hexagonal, concrete sidewalk right before the Muntinlupa City Hall.</p><p>I remember when the anti-smoking posters were numerous and varied around this area. It was a short time, but it was enough that looking back reveals that it stained my memories.</p><p>I remember walking up and down the broken elevator at the right side and outside of Starmall Alabang.</p><p>I remember joking about this place called &ldquo;David&rsquo;s Salon&rdquo; every time we walked past it on either the side of the street it was on or on the opposite side and when we were with either the former main church member David La Madrid or my older half-brother David.</p><p>I remember eating at the Shakey&rsquo;s there next to David Salon.</p><p>I remember the Christ&rsquo;s Commission Fellowship (CCF, stylized as &ldquo;ccf&rdquo;) signage above the frontage retail center which included the Shakey&rsquo;s and the David&rsquo;s Salon.</p><p>I remember when I ate at the Domino&rsquo;s Pizza next to this frontage retail center. I ate with JM, my sister, and probably my family.</p><p>I remember eating at the Burger Machine once next to the Minishop which was very close to Arkishop.</p><p>I think I remember the dark green of both Veterans Bank (stylized as &ldquo;veteransbank&rdquo;) and the medical clinic IMS Wellth Care, Inc.</p><p>I remember entering the Ministop a few times and feeling that it was like a secret treasure room.</p><p>I remember the fruit stalls at the start of 2736 Bruger St. from the viewpoint at the intersection.</p><p>I remember when the establishment at the corner at the left side from the same viewpoint changed their doors from transparent to a red-coated roll-up door.</p><p>I remember the Mightee Mart which was located next to the Mcdonalds and which the restaurant Greenwich replaced.</p><p>I remember the feeling of walking of walking past the Mightee Mart many times.</p><p>I remember the stall with glass panels at the entrance of the dental clinic &ldquo;E and E&rdquo; located at No. 36 National Road, Putatan, Muntinlupa City.</p><p>I think I remember entering the Generika drugstore at the opposite side of the street of the denta clinic. I remember the fruit stalls all around the parking lot of the interconnected line of establishments which included Generika.</p><p>I remember seeing the text &ldquo;PRESNEDI BLDG.&rdquo; at the side of the tall building next to the structure which included Mightee Mart and the dental clinic. The text was on the right side from the viewpoint of the street. It was on the right of the Mightee Mart retail center from the same viewpoint.</p><p>I remember the curve further ahead at around 14.392869770937425, 121.04457843850174.</p><p>I remember the path to a bustling market at 14.390091937498477, 121.04466062719158.</p><p>I remember seeing Laguna Del Bay many times.</p><p>I remember passing by Daang Hari Road many times especially along with Jeremiah and Tita Maris in their car.</p><p>I remember the numerous times I felt curious toward the way the bus contractors punched the bus tickets. The holes these punches made looked like volcanoes. I remember another method in punching holes wherein they would use a hole punch rather than whatever they used to punch holes that looked like volcanoes.</p><p>I remember hanging out at the basketball court many times in my life. I remember the white ground or floor that got slippery when it rained. I remember the feeling of sitting down at the bench many times probably during basketball games during my NCA era and whenever the youth of my main church would come and play. I remember the occupants who lived in the house next to the basketball court complaining one time.</p><p>I remember playing with certain occupants of Agro Homes Subd. at the basketball court. I remember when this one dude asked if I had asthma or something because I was struggling to play basketball. I think this was before or during the 2020 lockdown. I had many more memories before this one.</p><p>I remember the feeling of stepping of basketball courts that made one&rsquo;s shoes squeak, but for much of my life, the basketball courts to which I went were concrete.</p><p>I remember the feeling of running back and forth across the cement in my former main church during NCA days, preparing for National Student Convention I think. I remember seeing my teachers at the time wearing mint-green uniforms. I remember the way they cheered us on.</p><p>I remember seeing many leaves around this less-than-feet–wide portion of the road. A visible line divided this portion of the road at the side and the rest of the road. I remember the small sudden elevation between the road and the platform which belonged to house owners.</p><p>I remember grabbing the handles which formed out of the curvilinear design of the bars incorporated into the opening of the flight of stairs which peeked into the living room and even past the window to the outside. I remember even trying to do pull-ups through this handle because I was desperate to learn how to exercise a part of my body that I struggled to exercise with my body alone. This built up in excitement to my acquisition of a pull-up stand a year or a few years later</p><p>I remember the feeling of trying to dance in the living room and in the dining-cooking area because I wanted to dance but only had these rooms to express myself. It was hard to dance in the kids&rsquo; room upstairs due to the double-deck bed and the two thick, wide cabinets, among others.</p><p>I remember the feeling of grabbing a cane or stick of some sort and pretending to be an older man.</p><p>I remember the feeling of seeing the light of the refrigerator turn off right before I closed it. I did this several times.</p><p>I remember when I and probably JM went to this gated area in Agro Homes where JM dug up a weird worm or something.</p><p>I remember when I was playing in the Minecraft server. I remember rowing up to -30,000+ blocks away from the &ldquo;spawn point.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember when I showed my mother a video I edited that looked pretty nice and showed how certain sound designs come into play when deciding the changing of scenes especially. I believe this was around probably 10 months as of writing (2023-08-17 18:01:21).</p><p>My life changed when I moved into the kids&rsquo; room.</p><p>According to a Reddit post, the Dressrosa saga of One Piece occurred from around 2014 to 2016. That was the time I, my siblings, and my Dad watched One Piece week by week.</p><p>I think I remember having a dream about a bar in
Dorohedoro or a place that looked like
Dorohedoro. It could have been a scene in
Dorohedoro rather than a dream.</p><p>I remember listening to NF while making a pyramid in a hardcore world, but I died to a creeper that fell from one of the holes of the unfinished pyramid.</p><p>I remember the homeless person whom I often saw on the streets. He was tall with long hair and often carried a Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene (BOPP) bag.</p><p>I remember that whenever I saw a jute bag, I often associated it with the wealthy.</p><p>I remember that at several points, I associated laminated bags with wealth due to the fact that it often came with expensive products and clothes like the ones bought from Adidas.</p><p>I remember when my sister said that men either liked women with big breasts or &lsquo;children&rsquo; (with small breasts). It was a really defining moment of how much media can really affect how you perceive what is physically attractive especially when the worse kind of cases get the most attention as they are easier to set apart emotionally. In reality, however, people are so much more complex, and what defines a good relationship or what is attractive can differ and contrast widely.</p><p>I think I remember when I saw a race track for the first time. I remember thinking it was the coolest thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I remember feeling that way for a long time. I think that we might have had one. I remember seeing the race tracks everywhere and just being flabbergasted at how high tech and cool they were. I remember thinking that it was so fun seeing the cars go around and around on their own probably with electronic help or on their own with gravity. I remember just being so enamoured with them.</p><p>I remember the feeling of getting a pour of &ldquo;sopas&rdquo; from a stainless steel soup container with a stainless steel soup laddle into my thin, plastic bowl. Holding the bowl by the edges and the tiny foot ring did the trick for evading the brunt of the heat. I remember the colorful abstract or flowery designs of the plastic bowls.</p><p>I changed my font from &ldquo;Roboto&rdquo; to &ldquo;Baskervville&rdquo; and the Visual Studio Code theme from &ldquo;Light Modern&rdquo; to &ldquo;Ayu Light&rdquo; (as of writing before 2023-08-18 01:00:17).</p><p>I remember the feeling of waking up in the morning and asking myself whether what I did was right.</p><p>I remember the feeling of gliding through the air as I sat on the bus seats. I remember the feeling of asking myself whether what I was doing was the best thing.</p><p>I remember the feeling of anger. I remember the feeling that I was going to become everything that I ever wanted.</p><p>I remember writing down many times repetitively hundreds and hundreds of times: &ldquo;I shall become the epitome of grace and beauty.&rdquo; I did it in a frenzy because I was struggling or suffering. I struggling to bear with the guilt and shame of feeling so helpless while it felt like the world ran amok. I remember feeling and imagining that everyone around me were disappearing one by one and turning into wooden sculptures.</p><p>I remember the feeling of becoming everything and yet losing everything.</p><p>I remember writing down every single emotion I had on a notebook. When I was younger, I struggled with comprehension and only interpreted things based on people&rsquo;s emotional reactions and nuanced expressions, which relied on a child&rsquo;s mind with idiosyncratic access to the Internet at the time.</p><p>I remember seeing the font change which the Google extension &ldquo;Dark Reader&rdquo; provided in ChatGPT as well as various other websites such as &ldquo;mangakakalot.com&rdquo;.</p><p>I remember flying through the air as I jumped from the middle of the stairs all the way to the bottom of the stairs with support from my limbs pressing against the top of the railings.</p><p>I remember the feeling of picking apart chairs and finding a place to sit down amid the various rotations they expressed.</p><p>I remember the feeling of deriving contradistinction relating to the interplay between disorder and a sense of freedom and discovery from my messy room in consideration to my excitement which had abounded many times in this room via a multi-series of dance expressions, each containing emotional charge.</p><p>I remember the feeling of exhaling my deepest breaths like soothing a tyrant&rsquo;s rage or caressing the skin of a tsunami. This was usually after a very wild dance full of the emotional expressions of a teenager with bipolar I disorder and a case for extravagance in the way they posit themselves.</p><p>I remember expressing my aggrievances toward the people around me, aiming my shooting rifle of a mouth toward the witnesses of my suffering. I expected that they held my suffering as well, but I was wrong. They knew less than I knew regarding my condition and my state of mind. They knew less than me regarding my life despite the fact that I already felt that I was bordering on blankness of mind, all memories fading like the wind passing by.</p><p>I remember the feeling of pressing my neck against the edge of the coach and feeling its rough and spiky texture causing my sensitive skin redness and discomfort. Coupled with the sweat, this itchiness which I derived from the coach made me numb. Instead of irritation, the numbness I felt allowed me to express my inner longings to myself while meditating on the psychophysiological perspectives which pain provided.</p><p>I remember the feeling of staring at the pictures which stuck to the refrigerator on the mirror via magnets. I remember the feeling of curiosity and probably a sense of disgust toward the weakness which I&rsquo;ve grown to understand and caress like a baby or a new wound. I remember the feeling of staring at those photos and ignoring them as a part of my day, which I still do, which only adds to the sense of ignorance despite the fact that I was there in those pictures when they were taken. I was there, and yet, I am no longer the person which begetted those memories in the first place. I am a distant stranger to that self and thus the people after whom I had taken.</p><p>I remember the feeling of eating and stumbling with my hands as I adjusted each increment against the flow of the other tiny muscles which engendered the manipulations which I hoped would arrive at physical satisfaction rather than a sense of displacement revealed by a movement of the bearing toward the posterior part of the chair where I sat.</p><p>I remember the feeling of fighting the urge to sing in the mid of the terrifying thing—the feeling of staring into the outside while so knowing the implications and dictations which a fight between me and my parents imparted and which those present, including me, recognized. I remember yearning to mutter while the throat which I desired so much to control only yielded a sense of inner rage.</p><p>I remember the feeling of wanting to tear myself apart and turn myself into a clean bloom full of the adorations of goodness and the light which I sought while I sat on the pews and begged while crying during the tangential songs birthed from improvisation.</p><p>I remember the feeling of flying past the walls and turning myself into a state of pottery in my imagination. This was to escape the feeling of flesh which tied me down to abandonment, mockery, and frustrations.</p><p>I remember crying until my throat became dry and that the voice which resulted from this sounded like a cribriform rag.</p><p>I remember that for most of my life, I ate and finished almost everything offered to me.</p><p>I remember that around the time (5/17/2023) I made the Roblox game &ldquo;Roblox Tycoon Game&rdquo;, I was reading &ldquo;The Three-Body Problem&rdquo; by Liu Cixin. I was inspired by a certain scene in the book where the soldiers were doing something similar to a network of switches of which I created a prototype in the Roblox game.</p><p>I remember that around the time that I was making a Roblox game called &ldquo;Turn-based RPG!&rdquo;, I was doing Twitch livestreams. It was during after my two-month Twitch livestreaming period. However, according to the creation and edited date of the Roblox game, it occurred in February 9, 2019, which was very far away from my two-month Twitch livestreaming period around July 2019. Most likely, I remembered the Turn-based RPG during my Twitch livestreaming period.</p><p>I remember the way Ate Aya Rosales stared at me as she stood at the entrance to the youth church service area. It was like she was expecting something from me. I stared back but then kept walking until I was well over past her and inside the enclosed youth church service area. She did multiple times in various places, always giving off this vibe that made me wonder if she liked me because she seemed straightforward and confident with those whom she knew, while, for some reason, she seemed to set me apart based on what I had seen.</p><p>I remember the feeling of staring at the rain, the passing tricycle as I sat down at the portico of Lola Cecille&rsquo;s house. I remember the feeling of the smooth-topped cement balustrades. I remember sitting and lying down on them. I remember resting my back against the chair and listening to the way each separate dripping sounded in cacophony and order within one another&rsquo;s presence. I remember the feeling of sitting down with one leg on the left side of the a line of balustrades and another on the right side of the line, sitting atop it and rotating my legs around a balustrade under me like a snake. I think an aunt scolded me because I was sitting like that. When I was sitting there, I was also next to an open, man-made, rectangular canal to the right of the portico. I remember going out from the back of the house and seeing myself on the left side of the house from the viewpoint of the entrance. I remember the feeling of the thought of escaping past the back door especially with the darkness they exuded at night. I remember the loud sound of the banging of the screechy- and loose-hinged screen door mixed with the musky smell of the furniture and associated objects such as pillows and electric fans and the fabric used to cover, enclose, underlay, or pad them.</p><p>I remember the feeling of seeing the arrow-shaped fences of the house and the way the wall obstructed my view of the outside, attributing it to a sense of isolation and escape from society. It was even more pronounced when I went down to the basement where layers and layers, horizontal, vertical, and diagonal, and entertained the curious mind toward isolation and its concomitant drive for the fetishistic fantasies which the books exposed and imposed willingly unto those carrying only their offline and corporeal bodies to answer. These layers were books, and it was of the mature romance genre to which I felt drawn due to the restrained or brief and light expression of the subject in my own home along the books and the daily conversations. These layers were arranged like tsunamis hugging the room and as if they protruded from the walls, attached. I remember the feeling that I got regarding the manner in which the light shone toward a person bereft of the light in the wake of the morning and in the middle of the night when only the moon offered the color of blue. I remember the feeling of inane comfort I felt toward the ignorant sensibilities of those embroidered by the present and the distinct textures of the fabric on which I slept and the feeling of the cement floor which had a similar smoothness to and distinctness from the tile floors at home.</p><p>I remember the feeling of putting my hand against the books in meditative analysis of the physical sensations which the tips of my finger provided when placed against the manifold tactile gradient variations, altitudinal differences, angular measurements, and horizontal distances between key topographical features within the ravines and gullies, ridges and valleys, and plateaus and escarpments of the books.</p><p>I remembe the feeling of touching the moment of oblivion of reality by entering my input via the placement of my fingers along the edges of the padding of those books. I remember the explosion of imagination when reality began to slip and the perusing of my eyes against the fluid movements of the content arose one by one. I remember the sky-high feeling like I was in the clouds in the midst of the way each font seemed to scribble along like thunderous heavens placing their dictations upon my feeble mind.</p><p>I remember the feeling that I have apotheosized within the gravity-bending realms of that tiny little basement full of the mutterings of a man isolated from societal fervor and deeper within the slow living which the country side seemed to provide.</p><p>Yet, all of those faded away in place of time.</p><p>Time was my ancestor, telling me that one day was deficient for a full life, yet when I spoke my day into existence by identifying it and admiring it, I said that it was plain as day that it was good. (2023-08-18 03:02:23)</p><p>I remember when I woke up in the morning and dressed for school, feeling the rim of the pants stop where my hips were and the ends of my sleeves suspending right before they slammed into the top side of my fore arms. I remember the feeling of dancing, running, skipping, or briskly walking on the grey road sometimes along the line at the side. I remember the feeling of the sky speaking its thousand tongues. The movies provided me with grandiose perceptions of the world around me, and since I was a child, it was naturally so. It was sufficiently curious and subtle and intellectually stimulating—the experience of heading to school.</p><p>I remember the feeling of pressing my legs through and against the flat horizontal bars of the balcony railings. I remember feeling that the sky was my pearl because of the relaxation, yet it was a limited feeling because the reality hit me that my legs struggled due to the deficient length of the balcony to get a teenage human body, whose legs were flexed at an angle of 90 degrees anteriorly, in such a set of physical locational properties in order to sit down while staying aligned with the balcony bars.</p><p>I remember the feeling of paying attention to a plant and scanning its various parts, only to come up with the conclusion that plants were strangely textured, shaped, and formed. My mother and sister shared an enthusiasm for plants at home, which contrasted with my disinterest and regard for the complexities they offered. My mind was engaging manifold complexities already, which made it challenging for me to see and appreciate the scientific and nature-loving aspect of life.</p><p>I remember watching many times the radial splashes in a pond which a cascade of water serviced and enjoying the sombre expression of colors within the reflection of the water coupled with splash distortions. I remember seeing one in many places in my life, each attributing to a set of ideas, personality-identities, conceptual frameworks, sensual details, and identified interconnective relationships within the enviroments which conceived my profound experience with simply watching the cascade and the splashes in the pond like a baby discovering existence and its fabrics.</p><p>The ability of the brain to discern theoretical complexities began with a single instance of sensory experience such as the one mentioned earlier, the experience of watching the splashes and the acting water.</p><p>I remember the feeling of grabbing the sky and tossing it down onto the ground, which I imagined while reading and writing fiction books, especially those of the fantasy genre. It was an empowering experience to imagine myself a bigger and fatter being that could lift the reins of the world and cast it aside once I was bored.</p><p>I remember walking around on the horizontal line–textured ground on the road breaking from the primary road and running past Lola Cecille&rsquo;s house and down a long row of streets. The sight of children in the distance was few, but they provided an outlook of civilian life in the periphery of the Metro Manila area.</p><p>I remember the feeling of hearing stories all the time about the fact that the large lot of grass on the other side of the street used to be a farm or something. This lot spanned long probably up to the end of the road and past a gaze at the horizon could see.</p><p>I remember the sparkles and the loud pops at New Years&rsquo; Eve. I remember the feeling of holding the sticks which produced the fiery sparkles and the almost cumbersome feeling of holding them due to my rare instance of hearing and seeing large pops of sound and colorful flares on the noticeably angled road. The cheers and screams which camaraderie produced made either me or my siblings want to head inside after we learned that the main part of the light-flashing, firework show was over. I remember the feeling of still hearing the loud explosions through the window despite tucking myself deep in the basement of Lola Cecille&rsquo;s house. To be fair, that small, glass window was facing the street.</p><p>I remember waking up in the morning and seeing my reflection and that of other objects in the mirror. I often saw the white rack behind me on which generally family-shared towels and my removed clothes hung. I think the rack was a replacement for another rack, or maybe it might have been an inclusion to an empty side of the wall.</p><p>I remember the way the music of various songs played when I peeled my eyes against the monitor which provided me with an entropy of activites. I remember the feeling of listening to Minecraft songs and simultaneously adhering to a restriction myself to Christian music rather than a list of &ldquo;worldly&rdquo; music, from which I culturally and conveniently excluded Minecraft music. The term &ldquo;worldly&rdquo; was generally an allusion to pop songs and any mention of mature and sexual material in music and media.</p><p>I remember worldly music finding its way into my ears through the youth of my former main church when they brought guitars to various events and places and found themselves having free time to explore alternative solutions to waiting and inserting pop songs from the 2000s and early 2010s, especially Filipino ones.</p><p>I remember the feeling of waking up in the morning only to find myself imagining strange thoughts and bewildering strange imaginations. I remember the imagination or dream wherein I was in a room. This room levitated downward. I remember discovering a portrait sitting at a desk or table. I remember the eyes of the face in the portrait turning black of having black liquid run down across them. I remember seeing a flying whale probably.</p><p>I remember another dream wherein I was at school and doing various things. I remember</p><p>I remember the feeling of going outside and seeing various people charging about in various lines as if like soldiers waiting for the commander. This feeling only occurred in media rather than in my real life. In my reality, going outside in the streets and sidewalks was like entering a flock of pigeons nested next to and around one another. The numerous individuals passing through included those who wearing caps, backpacks having a large distribution of pockets, the provided relief of which emphasized the creases, wrinkles, and dirt that wear produced, synthetic jerseys with National Basketball Association (NBA) team logos and associated colors, and the more normal clothing which people wore in an urban area in a tropical climate such as elbow-length shirts, pants, uniforms, sleeveless shirts, shorts, slippers, sandals, and shoes.</p><p>I notice that middle-class teenagers here in the more urban part of the Philippines are often inspired by Black culture. It is rare that you see people dress or act like white people unless they are born in more affluent neighborhoods. Then, their lifestyles start to mirror those who live in the United States more in terms of disposition and attitude. Music taste is a key tell when determining how they interpret their socio-cultural environment and how they plan to live their lives accordingly.</p><p>People often respect Black people especially considering the large following of Filipinos in regard to basketball and the NBA. The PBA is quite big as well, but the fact that Filipino teenager boys say the likes of &ldquo;Kobe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Michael Jordan&rdquo; while acting out a basketball shooting form speaks volumes about the NBA appreciative culture here.</p><p>Naturally, the view that the teenage populations which I encountered have only this propensity is deceptive. My abundance of exposure to manifold cultural insertions of older Gen Z and Millennial individuals enable me to endorse the regard that my delineations pertaining to various teenage lifestyles only span further.</p><p>I remember the culture shock of seeing my cousin Jeremiah leave uneaten food at a fast food restaurant. To me, who looked at fast food restaurants as luxury zones wherein people expressed themselves freely in loud voices (partly considering that &ldquo;the customer is right&rdquo;), Jeremiah&rsquo;s behavior was a defiance of my expectations of normalcy, etiquette, and self-respect. Yet, learning that Jeremiah and his family, as shown by his older brother&rsquo;s unspoken rules which he voiced out when I revealed the difference in our perspectives and my ignorance of these rules, had their own set of rules made me feel estranged and curious. Once I understood the systemic nodes and the various factors which engender the establishment of such habits, behaviors, mannerisms, preferences, and systems of belief through an interplay of my accumulated life and knowledge culminating through a traumatic point, my curiosity died down, and I soon lost interest. This was a matter of spent time close to a decade, so the brevity of my statement is deceptive.</p><p>I remember entering into a state of depression and spending a great portion of my time trying to express myself. One of the books I wrote during that time was one titled &ldquo;What Do I Want&rdquo; which I remember the most from my older literary works. It was for a long time that I struggled to express myself, and as time passed, I recognized the growing gravity of the issue and found my frustration deepening. It was only recently that I have achieved a skill level of writing wherein my ability far surpasses even that of myself 8 months ago enough to write a fantasy book, which I titled with several project code names, ending with &ldquo;In the Maelstorm&rsquo;s Embrace,&rdquo; well over past 100,000 words and begin writing this autobiography. Currently, this autobiography is at 117,640 words, which is a very large number compared to the 500-word fiction works which I made numerous attempts to produce (all of which most likely to infinitesimal satisfaction).</p><p>I remember my ignorant satisfaction with my poor level of writing when I was writing &ldquo;What Do I Want&rdquo;. In comparison to my older literary works such as my abandoned series &ldquo;The Forge of Brothers&rdquo;, this work showed much more promise in regard to my imaginative mind and to grammar. I wrote The Forge of Brothers in 2016 with a poor understanding of formatting despite my competent spelling. I used commas in places enough that it felt jarring. My comprehension of setting was largely imaginative rather than embodying a transpositional relationship of imagination and communication. I identified emotions poorly because my comprehension of emotions were strong but deficient in communicating those complex emotions which I experienced and identified easily outside of writing. However, in ignorance of the context, the writing style is enjoyable due to the nature of the established, friendly communicative relationship between the characters and the simple but definitive way they interact in fight scenes.</p><p>I remember when I learned that Leslie allegedly liked me. I expressed little interest in the prospect of taking upon myself the burden of handling someone in light of the caution which such circumstances I supposed coerced. I believe that in spite of this, Leslie was capable and well-aware of enough of my background to determine that any interaction regarding a romantic relationship would usually be detached and fleeting when by chance rather than deep-rooted and ingrained when by a premeditated choice founded on a series of re-assessments and overhauls of either my, her, and our mode of living from interpersonal to intrapersonal and psychosocial matters. Such a series of changes would be too challenging for teenagers to accomplish despite the high level of harmonious family ties in our culture. Likely, however, these specific words were most likely outside of both our minds even if we understood faintly regarding the nature or romantic relationships and marriage and its &ldquo;traditionally achievable&rdquo; orientation within a family-oriented culture. Ultimately, we experienced deprivations which made the means for such accomplishments difficult even if we believed that they were possible and customary.</p><p>&ldquo;Housing prices have gone up I say!&rdquo; is a sentiment I hear often. I mention that jokingly, but that is one way of interpreting the complexities if it adds to the levity which the stressful environment demands in respect to the hardships faced.</p><p>The more sleepy I am, the more likely I am to stare at pretty women and find them attractive and alluring. I usually easily ignore even pretty women and feel nothing because I am busy thinking about things that I care about, but when I&rsquo;m sleepy, I think my rudimentary primal urges come out. For example, after being staying awake for 17 hours, I get a sudden urge and think that the image of the woman that I ignored many times for the last 17 hours is attractive and worth staring at. This image came up often because they emerged often in my Youtube recommendation list.</p><p>I remember when my mother often placed the clothes iron on the books located on the rightmost topmost cell of the four-column bookshelf. I remember her sitting on the tiled floor next to the cord which was either connected to one of two sockets in a set embedded in a load-bearing wall directly or to a poly-socket extension cord connected to that wall socket. I remember seeing my NCA clothes and polo clothes for church being ironed on that blue and yellow bedding.</p><p>When I went down the stairs, a rug stood next to the wall across the path connecting the living room to dinner-kitchen room with the end of a flight of stairs in between whence I came. The rug had a large, intricately pattern, composed of many different shapes, synthesizing an abstract texture in dominant colors of shades of grey with accents of white and some black.</p><p>From my viewpoint, next to the rug on the left side, a black dustpan supporting its weight and upholding its stability stood exactly opposite to the wall behind it, while a partnered broom was leaned and mounted on it. The decals of the brush, which illustrated the name of their brand, partially remained, showing persistence on the right side top of the pan. The broom was minimally designed with only the light yellow of the shaft and the golden hay-like color of the brush. What set this brush apart was the absence of two expected markers of a normal brush: the hook and the band. This hook, which was usually composed of plastic twine rope, either protruded or drooped from the topmost portion of the shaft. In conjunction, the band wrapped around the cylindrical brush portion clinging to the shaft, performing the role of a bind and a visual separator in between the shaft and the brush. My delineation of the black dustpan and its various details only hint at the more lengthy and intricate milieus surrounding it and in which it contributes as that promoting factor of intricate cultural ties and bonds within a functional domiciliary environment.</p><p>Among the arrangement of cardboard receptacles farther to the left and a few feet in front of hte door, I see atop some of these boxes a &ldquo;Savemore&rdquo; branded green polypropylene bag. I remember the monochrome brand graphics</p><p>I remember when I pressed a plastic bottle into my mouth and clamped it. I remember that I would make noises and listen to the distorted, damped, frequency-shifted sound with certain reinforced frequencies.</p><p>I remember when I would place objects close to my eyes and lean them against my face to explore sensorially the visual alteration and distortion which those objects generated and to explore the items themselves from an intimate, analytical perspective.</p><p>I remember seeing my shadow and my hair reflected on the ground and on various objects such as phones, books, and food.</p><p>I remember when I wanted to find a way to turn off keyboard input on the &ldquo;Tab&rdquo; key programatically because &ldquo;alt-tabbing&rdquo; was causing issues probably with the screencasting and streaming application &ldquo;OBS Studio&rdquo;.</p><p>I remember when I attempted to assemble myself and my brother toward an incipient form of motion picture filming while we were at the financial business district of Bonifacio Global City. I remember that we were at the park and I encouraged my brother into pursuit of productivity via the appropriation of our neglected leisure time. I remember collaborating regarding the position and angle in which my brother Timothy aimed the active camera at my figure as I walked in the opposite direction as the camera. I began walking from the left outside of frame, entering the frame and then stopping once I have walked a considerable distance (probably around 8 meters). Then, picking up the tripod on which the camera was mounted, Timothy recognized the need to advance in my direction to get a more inclusive angle of me. I then approximated my steps and considered in which I supposed the camera perceived me and everything else visible within its field of view geometrically and oligo-chromatically, both of which usually lend to competent and satisfying cinema. I remember when Timothy directed me to the sidewalk in front of the road. I remember worrying regarding whether the passersby would stare at me and thus discern my impotence in cultural decorum and my enacted desertion of my societal designation like a soldier who fled westward when the theater was in the east. I felt sensitively and expressed affectively similarly when I was alone.</p><p>I remember sitting down and staring at the camera, watching the time transcending me. In another scene, I remember feeling discomfort because of either what my father said or how he spoke either to or in regard of me while we were sitting together at one of the park tables.</p><p>I remember the sense of disorientation I felt after suppressing the anxiety and sense of alienation my father impinged upon me eventually. During this, I sat and drank blended iced coffee deep inside a Starbucks outlet at the periphery of the park. Additionally, this outlet had columns and transparent glass walls, which gave a view of the adjacent mall aisle. Moreover, this aisle featured an annular concrete bench with a thick width for spacious sitting. Finally, in the coffee came in a 8-inch-tall, 4-inch-thick, 20-ounce plastic vessel, the top of which had an inverted concave shape.</p><p>I remember the feeling of entering a retail store at a site wherein it was bereft of the amenities a customer expects from a commercial entity of a first-class mall. However, the casual motivations of those in such places of lack characterized it against its limitations. Even so, within the accompanying domestic cultural context, this lack is yet replete with the close family ties and easygoing bonds which such environments facilitate due to the evolutionary incipience of that store.</p><p>I remember seeing several close associates, including my mother, the girls at my former main church, and even David La Madrid I think, wear flowers on their ear probably as a result of coming into an exchange with flower vendors, whho were usually children or juveniles. Subsequently, these flowers might have been souvenirs from a party promptly thrown away during the return home.</p><p>I remember the combined smell of the aircon and the red mattress and how it affected my first impression of the aircon when we first moved here to our apartment I believe.</p><p>I remember that I took a picture of myself at a bathroom at a mall in BGC. Additionally, I was wearing my crocodile-green polyester shirt. The picture is gone because the staff at the repair center had to empty the memory of my phone after it dropped, the screen cracked, and I forgot my password.</p><p>I remember that probably around the same time, in a hardware store, in the mall, when I saw a tall, white person, who was probably American. Specifically, he was probably over two feet taller than me, as I was only five feet and four inches tall, which is around the average height in my country.</p><h3 id=jeagre>JEAGRE
<a class=anchor href=#jeagre>#</a></h3><p>This was around the time I saw a girl squint at me when I glanced at the store and its design, the large distribution of customers relative to the other stores, and the large signage inside, all of which I found extraordinary at the time. However, the girl might have taken my glance wrongly considering she looked happy and then suddenly exposed a pinch of disapproval. \pagebreak Additionally, this is that instance which reminds me that consumers who live in more tourist-inviting, affluent places are more likely to absorb outside Western Internet culture rather than local Filipino Internet culture.\footnote{It is important to note that Western Internet culture and Filipino culture are expectedly intricate and intersect at various points such as in the LGBTQ movement while retaining some level of diversion within those markers of pop culture. Similarly, &ldquo;spectrum&rdquo; is a sufficient word to describe the importance of the interaction of Internet media despite and still in respect to that geographical distance and the implications thereof.} Indeed, the lifestyles pervasive in Western media (juvenile Internet pop culture) aligns with the postmodernist ideas experienced by those who scrutinize and endure disillusionment under modernist and traditionalist expectations. Moreover, the negative portrayal of men in certain contexts influence the propensity of women to recognize ogling stares and upbraid them but, naturally from time to time, mistake normal glances for those same stares. Ultimately, the alienation which some men experience as a result of their deprivations comes into conflict with the violations and transgressions of those considerations which appeal to equality rather than to that mode which pertains to a divided role of superior and inferior within marital and socio-gender dynamics.</p><p>I&rsquo;m one of the 5% that experience regular episodes of sleep paralysis.</p><p>I remember the structural format of the shack which I encountered midway through one of my multivarious backcountry sojourns trekking up ridges and dirt and limestone mounds, escarpments, and rock faces. Anyway, Firstly, the shack had two benches made from rows of halved bamboo nailed onto lumber frames. Furthermore, these benches faced one another, one facing to the left and another facing to the rest. in the meantime, facing the center in between the benches, I stood on the side away from both of them while being positioned between them. All in all, this created a triangular layout where the benches and my position formed the corners of a triangle. Then, I entered along with many other hikers and laid my head back against the backrest of the bench on which I sat. This leads us to the bamboo flooring, the &ldquo;Nipa palm&rdquo; roofing, and the bamboo pillars on the four corners which form the corners of a square. Even so, I think it might have lacked or lost the Nipa roofing. Either way, as per convention, it probably had single-type lumber wall frames and mixed lumber floor frames. To conclude, I remember that the shack was next to and probably relied on the earth side of an ascending path on a hill maybe as a result of time and the concomitant pluvial erosion especially in respect to the neglect-associated remoteness of its site.</p><p>On the mountains, I would usually find plant species such as \emph{Imperata cylindrica} (Cogon Grass), \emph{Saccharum spontaneum} (Talahib, Wild Sugarcane), \emph{Tithonia diversifolia} (Wild Sunflowers), \emph{Bidens pilosa} (Bidens), \emph{Pennisetum} species (Various species within the Pennisetum genus), \emph{Pennisetum purpureum} (Elephant Grass), \emph{Pennisetum clandestinum} (Kikuyu Grass).</p><p>I remember another shack whose structural features aligned more with that of a standard &ldquo;kubo&rdquo; at NCA which was also my former main church.</p><p>I feel that every time a ball-like event occurred when I was a child, I could see hundreds of lights flashing down on me from the chandeliers static at the ceiling and from accent lights pointing in various directions. Also, the numerous food in numerous tinges of yellow and white and their smells which shot blasts into my nose as if to a dog&rsquo;s. Indeed, that was how vivid those memories were. Moreover, I remember everything but the complex interactions of people because I was still a child. Additionally, I understood the loud sounds of utensils tinging against plates and voices and the hurried tones amid the eating at round or rectangular tables and the bystanders lining up for the catering. Therefore, I understood everything about the feeling that the kingdoms have come and they are here to mingle. Yet, these kingdoms which adopt the associated visual form of great castles or fortresses were the simple people in elaborate clothing. Similarly, the mingling was their casual and discreet interactions. Ultimately, I experienced everything with great reverie as if the kingdoms of the land had claimed their thrones on the seats at the tables which looked like towers hanging from the sea.</p><p>I struggled to deal emotionally with the subjects of guilt and sexual desire, always damning myself one way or the other. At one point, I slammed my hips with a spoon, teeth gritted. Despite this, those around me, from whom I wanted to get away and be alone, reacted softly. Moreover, I remember the years of staring outside, suppressing years of pain in a bottle in my heart, hoping that I could just tear it out of me. Simultaneously, I dealt with hives cyclically probably after eating seafood or shellfish from a kiosk selling takoyaki.</p><p>I will do everything.</p><p>Haircuts I&rsquo;ve seen: buzzcut with squarish head shape.</p><p>The texture of the handle of the cabinet.</p><p>Mary in the manger in films and Christmas movies</p><p>The texture and feeling of the wood and the brush of the cordate plaque with a Bible verse.</p><p>I remember the board made of cork with wooden typography that looked like metal type used in letterpress.</p><p>The echo of triggering the locking mechanism in the door at Jeremiah&rsquo;s old house and hearing it reverberate across the large area.</p><p>The smell of food and the brick stove.</p><p>I remember that around the time I was watching Youtube videos regarding &ldquo;creepypastas,&rdquo; that was also the time I saw videos about Happy Wheels and various horror games. I think I saw the Youtubers &ldquo;Markiplier&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pewdiepie&rdquo; playing them alongside many other Youtubers who faded out of popularity.</p><p>I remember when I saw hundreds of first-person shooter video game–inspired short films on Youtube. I remember seeing ones depicting actual guns and others depicting nerf guns. I remember finding them exciting.</p><p>I remember the feeling of hearing a group of people singing together many, many times.</p><p>\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}</p><p>I remember that when I was at the &ldquo;Incredibots&rdquo; online forums in 2013, I capitalized the first letter of every word, signifying a germinal stage in my comprehension of the fundamentals of writing in respect to the sameness of typing on a keyboard and writing on a piece of paper. Moreover, I imprinted my writing with a large text formatting style. Both my all-word capitalization and this style challenged the norms of the forum. Consequently, a user and member of that forum, whose username was &ldquo;haapz&rdquo;, urged against using them and admonished me regarding another matter, wherein they claimed that I published the same &ldquo;forum thread&rdquo; 4 times. Subsequently, I remember confirming that I understood and saw where my fault lay. However, based on the succeeding reports I sent, I either forgot, failed to understand, or ignored the user&rsquo;s suggestion completely. In another user&rsquo;s case, first, they echoed and expanded the former user&rsquo;s concern about my poly-publishing, bolstering the validity of the claim. Secondly, they elaborated in undertones of regard and direct interest toward the refinement of the embedded content in the reports I sent. As for this refinement, they posited an alteration in the mechanisms of the virtual robot which was the content I assembled. Namely, I remember their term &ldquo;Self Balancing Stick&rdquo; and their username &ldquo;Fearnbus25&rdquo;.</p><p>Significantly, according to my profile information on Incredibots, I created an account here on Tuesday, April 9, 2023, at 2:11 AM. I was awake at 2:11 AM, which is strange because I remember that I adhered to strict curfews and limited playing times under my parents&rsquo; jurisdiction. Specifically, my mother was the enforcer because she was the housewife; however, she often went outside and engaged in church and outreach affairs. Secondly, my father was more of an erratic element in the mix because of his ignorance regarding the nuanced positive aspect of the rest of the family&rsquo;s dynamics since he was almost always at work. Even up to now, he complained and berated often, which only served the self-fulfilling prophesy of treating someone horribly until they convert into what you believed they were from the start. Also, I continue to expand my exhaustive arguments regarding my father&rsquo;s interpersonal deprivations and the impacts thereof. Coincidentally, he only saw the negative side since he came home at night when everyone was tired. Moreover, since he was exhausted as well, the party of my father and the party of the rest of the family diverged. As years passed, the distance between both parties became well-defined, and the affected interactions became more predictable, adversely fostering an ever-prolonged lull in communications. Conversely, rather than embodying a two-party family, the complex, ongoing relationships between us siblings allowed intermittence of distances and various gaps in communication which serve to complicate the interactions markedly familiar of my family further. Even so, it was strict enough that I remember the occasions where I did get extra playing time. Finally, this reprieve was usually due to events or right before leaving for a family outing, among other factors.</p><p>I remember playing the FPS video game &ldquo;Crossfire Online&rdquo; on the computer at home, then jumped from the computer desk straight to the bed, and covered myself with a pillow because my half-sister was going down the stairs from the second floor. Moreover, I think I remember that in the game, I was using the assault rifle &ldquo;SCAR Light&rdquo; (SCAR-L). At any rate, she rebuked me since I was playing longer than I should have late at night. Also, I think that I was out of the private school NCA around this time and was starting to reap the benefits of having more time since I was homeschooled. However, I think the tensions at home increased since my sister was attending school, which might have put some pressure on her as the only one going to college at the time. Though, I think Kuya Paulo might have been attending as well, but I do remember that he often skipped classes to play at Internet cafés (locally called &ldquo;computer shops&rdquo;).</p><p>I remember being so excited when I and my siblings could play LAN (local area network) with each other at home after we got a second computer. Indeed, that lasted for a long time. Soon enough, the older PC (personal computer) broke and that motivated us to play at Internet cafés more I think.</p><p>I remember so visually enraged and emphasizing and echoing the term &ldquo;cause and effect&rdquo; to my father.I</p><p>I remember when we headed to the port. I remember watching the manifold tricycles parks.</p><p>I think I remember seeing someone sleeping in a tricycle.</p><p>I felt estranged when I saw that the relatives on my grandmother&rsquo;s side lived poorer lives. Indeed, my sense of confusion deepened when I compared cyclically the various cultural accents of these relatives and my other much wealthier relatives from Jeremiah&rsquo;s side whenever I visited each side.</p><p>I remember seeing the &ldquo;bolo&rdquo; knife which Jerry used at my former main church. Moreover, I remember that Jerry left because of some issues probably related to the fact that he developed an infatuation with my married mother. Anyway, it is likely that a guide on one of my hiking trips used a bolo to open a coconut since I have witnessed vendors break open coconut which they took from a cart</p><p>I remember the design of this cart. Namely, shaped like tiny rectangular cuboids, wooden securing brackets protruded regularly across the side of the cart, probably serving to nail the container of the cart to the cart itself. Similarly, from the back of the container, the metal wheels were positioned below and around 8 inches to 1 foot and 2 inches forward in space, leaving out 1 foot and 4 inches to 1 foot and 8 inches of room from this position to the front. Generally, the wheels are set closer to the back than to the front of the cart. Besides, the two shafts which join the metal handle branched out from within the holes in the floor of the container on the left and the right side. Also, these shafts were either nailed or, more rarely, mortised to the base of the cart. In addition, it is common to see a small distribution of nail holes in the brackets, the bottom, and the ends of the shafts which are exposed at the sides of the base. Specifically, the rims of these nail holes were black-coated usually with a downward tapering black probably as a result of a combination of factors: oxidation, fungal growth, stains, among others. From another angle, the sides of the container often protrude because they are too long or create corner gaps because they are too short. At the bottom side of the cart, a large, trapezoidal block of wood enclosed the axle, likely housing the slide bearing or, less likely, acting as the slide bearing itself, protruding toward the front and exposing itself on the side of the wheels from the lateral viewpoint. Regarding the shafts, from the tip of the cart container to the high tips of the shafts, it spanned from around 10 inches to 1 foot and 1 inch. A few centimeters from these tip, a metal rod, which served as a handle, was suspended from two holes in the shalf, passing through them. Considering its makeup, this rod was most likely hollow, while it might have had a thick rim. At any rate, the natural edges of the lumber making up the cart was exposed. Additionally, the high tips of the shafts terminated in wedges whose thicker ends pointed outward to the sides. Besides, cropped vinyl branded banners were plastered around the exposed side of the wheels. Rather than adjusting it so that the brand logos and colors were coherent and esthetically geometric, the functional aspect of covering that exposed side motivated this placement. Also, since the wheel was made of metal, the axle and the associated parts were likely metal as well. Anyway, in conclusion, a single, long block of the type of wood which the cart used and which measured around 8 to 9 feet could be bought for 100 to 200 pesos from a nearby, nonproprietary, bare-windowed, cheap, lumber store and then processed in a branded woodshop.</p><p>I remember the various combinations of movements I gradually registered into muscle memory while navigating the household over the years, supporting the notion that the human brain was an automatic compiler of information.</p><p>I remember the blue light which shone through the blue, polycarbonate, stripe indent–patterned roof in my family&rsquo;s garage. In another case, I remember seeing a white one in Jeremiah&rsquo;s house. Regarding its frequency of use, I think I remember seeing it in various places besides the aforementioned instances since it is a relatively common feature in wealthier areas even in commercial buildings.</p><p>I remember when we bought the red paper from National Book Store.</p><p>I remember the feeling of the notification buzz or shake when I had my older blue phone and when I first got my HUAWEI JNY phone. I remember getting Messenger buzz notifications of messages from others. I remember getting buzz notifications from video games, probably from ones like Clash of Clans when I was still playing with family and some friends in the clan &ldquo;For the Cross&rdquo;. I think these game notifications were also for ones such as Zombie Tsunami and probably that Knight game. My username is &ldquo;SamyUi&rdquo;, and I forgot the password to my gmail &ldquo;<a href=mailto:samuicoc@goodepeople.com>samuicoc@goodepeople.com</a>&rdquo;. I wonder if it could have been another name before I changed it to <a href=mailto:nunchisamuelperigidig@gmail.com>nunchisamuelperigidig@gmail.com</a>.</p><p>I remember the feeling of seeing people like my mother and various older people have phones. I remember borrowing and playing in the Nokia phone for a long time and enjoying myself playing the game where you jump on platforms while vertically going up in a tower-like structure. I remember the snake game and finding that enjoyable many times. I remember when Kuya Paulo, David, or both played it or hearing that they played it and got a long snake, which meant a high score.</p><p>I remember playing so many mobile games and finding a way to enjoy myself for so long.</p><p>I remember that when I was in a camp or conference or something in Baguio, when I spoke to Jopel and another person regarding life, I was infatuated with a random girl there or something. Throughout the many camps and events, I felt infatuated with many girls my age and women years older than me only for the duration of those events.</p><p>I remember that while helping out or asking help from Jerry (Gerry), the brother of former pastor Malou from my former main church, I saw a messily opened package box which contained bands in order to thin out the belly. This was around the time he was seeking out my mother. Specifically, this was after he gazing lengthily at my mother weirdly while standing next to the blue, grainy, metal column of the roofing of Building A and Building B and resting his right hand on this column. My mother was walking and leaving out of gates during this time. I remember my mother confirming that Jerry was indeed infatuated with her. I remember her giving Jerry a consoling hug from behind and saying that &ldquo;it&rdquo; was impossible as Jerry was sitting down inside the kitchen area while the two portions of that area were together rather than separated into the kitchen area and the office or storage area. I remember thoroughly watching this interaction happen; I think my mother was ignorant of my contextual awareness. In the end, the wall which separated the two areas changed little regarding the roles these areas adopted.</p><p>I remember when my sister and Kuya Glenn were sitting at the lego table full of regular tubes for interconnecting lego parts to it. I remember that they kissed and that I remarked that they did. I remember reporting what they did to my mother.</p><p>I might have reported once to my father, but my father was on the fence and tolerant regarding my sister&rsquo;s behavior which my mother detested. My father might have calmed down throughout the years when I was still too young to understand.</p><p>I was on the Internet around the peak when people made fun of Justin Bieber. I remember recognizing that trend even on the videos of the Youtuber &ldquo;Niga Higa&rdquo; by Ryan Higa. Also, I remember that one video where a person pretended to be Justin Bieber and, while under the mocking pretense, drank milk and acted as if they had diarrhea.</p><p>In my lifetime, I saw the plurality of speakers and their concomitant multiplicity of facets. Naturally, one of the first preachers that I remember to whom I listened was former pastor Simeon. Secondly, it was rare that I got to see my mother preaching to my family one on one. Moreover, it was often that I saw my mother preaching to a large group of people in other places hosting a wide range of frequent church events such as camps and various seminars, and many more. (Refer to the Table of Contents under &lsquo;Chapter 8: Historical Events for a comprehensive list.) Anyway, thirdly, I remember a pastor at Christian Commission Fellowship (ccf) when I went there with Jeremiah. Fourthly, I remember that pastor with the moustache and who behaved like a playboy. For the fifth set, I remember the various pastors of New Life Church: the male pastor with the glasses with the very calm, humorous, enthusiastic temperament of a young wiseman, a male pastor who often appeared as a singer with a guitar but also showed his prowess in addressing the church albeit with mostly staid body language yet with a decently dynamic voice, a female pastor who shared the same rhetorical and oral characteristics as the previous male pastor but also revealed a pre-ideological, superficial strictness from time to time which extended to this male pastor, making their distinct physical appearances and interpersonal history the contextual foundations for the external perception of their mirrored temperaments, and a female pastor whose body language morphs expressively and who laughs and expresses herself with exposed passion, among others. Sixth, I remember the very numerous pastors to whom I listened and at whom I gazed throughout scores of events, especially those of the &ldquo;Church of the Nazarene.&rdquo; Lastly, the speakers at the several &ldquo;National Prayer Gatherings&rdquo; introduced unique sets of personalities to my rhetorical fountain of memories and understanding.</p><p>I remember that sometimes, while I passed stool or took a shower, I imagined the scenario wherein the bathroom which I was using was actually the bathroom from upstairs or the one downstairs since the two bathrooms look very similar.</p><p>I remember when &ldquo;Ama,&rdquo; my late grandmother from my father&rsquo;s side, would visit us. I remember how awkward it felt for my half-sister and the rest of the family. I think that often, my siblings would go upstairs or hide in the bathroom while she was there. I remember that she used the bathroom attached to the kids&rsquo; room several times. I remember that around that time, I was staying downstairs mostly and only going upstairs to study or sleep. I remember that I would often sleep downstairs on the floor anyway. Ama usually wore a blouse with flowery patterns and pants or leggings I think.</p><p>I remember the smell of the seats of fancy cars or of certain establishments. On only one sniff of this, a bricolage of memories protruded, emerged.</p><p>I remember the feeling of waking up and seeing a bright sun staring down at me only to feel that maybe I was the only one feeling this way.</p><p>I remember the spirit of god flying above the sky meeting everyone on the ground, suffusing each one with spiritual fervor. In the end, now, that feels like a lifetime ago. When was I before I was I? A dog, a cat, what am I? A bird? A soaring turd? Fuck, if only I knew what was coming, just sordid tired little pieces of me just waiting about. What next? Airplane booming? What next? UFO emerging? What next? The sky falls down on me? Who cares when my life was so complete and full of things I could never comprehend. I just am so&mldr; human. It&rsquo;s too much to be human without being everything that I love—want—need—I desperatedly need to get away from this thing that I am. Sinless; sinful. That&rsquo;s me. I am everything that I wanted to be, and yet, I am everything that I believe I shouldn&rsquo;t be—weak, no, tired, just poopy. Feeling that way. It&rsquo;s like I heard: &ldquo;Yes, Sam, you&rsquo;re on a ship. Time to go to space! Everything&rsquo;s going to be alright.&rdquo; Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I heard alright. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. All of these words fail to convey what I feel, and that&rsquo;s the truth. It sounds like nonsense because it&rsquo;s so hard to connect the dots between things that are beyond just a paragraph to express. It would take years. Decades. Centuries. To express this all, and yet, it would only take several years to write something that&rsquo;s within my capacities I think. I am capable of writing them enough that I can tell myself I was there even in the most slightest form.</p><p>In my country, it was often that I heard people from various different places joke around from time to time by putting an &ldquo;s&rdquo; at the end of each word when they spoke in English. For example, they would say, &ldquo;Is ams thes bests ofs alls times.&rdquo; The correct version of this would be &ldquo;I am the best of all time.&rdquo; Furthermore, if a word already had &ldquo;s&rdquo; originally, they would sometimes say the &ldquo;s&rdquo; sound again once they inserted it with an &ldquo;s&rdquo;.</p><p>The goal of this autobiography might be a belaboring process considering the numerous learning curves in front of me.</p><p>I remember that every time my father listened the &ldquo;music cover&rdquo; Youtube video wherein the cover band &ldquo;Boyce Avenue&rdquo; performed &ldquo;Wherever You Will Go&rdquo; by The Calling, I would remember very emotionally charged moments of my life wherein my father was a vital factor. Similarly, the subtle changes in the tone of my father&rsquo;s voice alerted me to various situations depending on the configuration in which that instance of tonal change was structured.</p><p>\begin{figure}[h]

</code></pre><p>\end{figure}</p><p>I remember the cylindrical, lattice, metal pencil holder we had in NCA and the various times I got the sharp tips of my pencils broken and felt my skin hurt from pressing my fingers against these tips.</p><p>I remember seeing Jeremiah standing during roll call inside the classroom in NCA. I think he was already all around this time, but I might be wrong.</p><p>I think Jeremiah might have been sad when I said I forgot when Jeremiah mentioned that he used to be thin after I asked when he used to be thin or something like that.</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to die.</p><p>I remember when I played Minecraft. I remember the mob farms that I often saw. I think I built my first mob farms in creative mode rather than in survival mode. I think I did build some mob farms in survival mode, but the last one I remember was the one either I or a viewer built in my Minecraft server for viewers, which I called my &ldquo;viewer SMP (Survival Multiplayer)&rdquo;. Typically, the &ldquo;mob farm&rdquo; is a structure which begins with a long, hallow, vertical shaft and terminates at the top in a large rectangular container which greatly exceeds the volume of the bottom part.</p><p>I remember when I went to MCA with my older half-brother David and my mother Carina Calata Pe as a part of a prayer meeting or something. I remember seeing several students who were alumni by the time I started going to MCA in 2017. I remember seeing my mother hug the principal Yna when we were about to leave I think. My mother might have been a speaker in that meeting full of students.</p><p>I remember going up and down the staircase and entering the classroom upstairs during a school event that involved the parents downstairs in MCA. I remember one of my classmates leaving the door open while the aircon was on. Going upstairs during something happening downstairs and leaving the door open was an often occurrence. Though, I do remember that we closed it. I remember seeing Nikos press against the door as he opened and closed it, looking at me sneakily. I remember seeing many motivational or Bible- or school-related graphics on the walls of the classroom.</p><p>I remember that I would often see the door of the higher-grade classroom next to mine open. I remember seeing Teacher Alvin standing inside probably and seeing students from that classroom wearing backpacks and going outside. I remember that I would often see certain students being late and staying. Though, the set of students staying late would change frequently or periodically throughout the school year. I remember that seeing the chairs inverted and on top of the desks in both classrooms.</p><p>I finally remembered specific details of memories from 6 years ago. I blocked them out 4 years ago due to related many traumatic experiences, and for 4 troubled years, I forgot. I remembered them today. The previous paragraph depicted those memories which I recovered just now.</p><p>I&rsquo;m talking about specific details that were trivial rather than traumatic. It&rsquo;s just that my brain did a shotgun approach to blocking out my traumatic memories, making me forget details that were related in time and location but separate from the actual events. I remembered those memories, which makes me glad.</p><p>I remember the second-floor bathroom upstairs in MCA. I remember hearing students shouting through a window from outside in front of the school building at the parking lot. I remember that the window was too high that I could only see the clouds and the sky.</p><p>I remember that the bathroom was around a corner. Before the bathroom, I passed by a bench next to the wall connected to the bathroom. Moreover, this light reddish-brown–coated bench had a flat top rather than a backrest, and its legs were shaped like an inverted right trapezoid facing inward. Finally, the hex color of the bench was around \textit{#C49292}.</p><p>I think I remember that the floor of MCA had vinyl tiles rather than ceramic ones.</p><p>From the viewpoint of the end of the staircase on the second floor, I remember that the door to the principal Yna&rsquo;s office was next to the bench on the right.</p><p>I remember going up to her and either telling her or hearing her talk regarding the strict behavior of the senior high student who was training us for &ldquo;tchoukball&rdquo; competition in National Student Convention.</p><p>I remember that this student got sick due to food poisoning. I think they announced it during roll call and added that it was the probably the fault of the water I think.</p><p>When I talked to Shane and Kathleen Lam, I remember that I was in front of the school building at the entrance.</p><p>I remember seeing this one girl from the higher grade. I only remembered her now, forgetting her for 4 years even though she was very nice like a lot of other students. She was one of those people who was less concerned about looking like a mysterious, introverted weirdo and more concerned about just hanging out and doing their thing.</p><p>I remember grabbing a bat and swinging it until the sky became a beautiful haven. I remember eating flesh until the blood and gore turned into beautiful pieces of art. I remember feeling that I was there and not there at the same time. I remember flying off a cliff, my skirt drifting with the wind, and my hat trying to keep itself from flying off. Maybe, my umbrella flew off as well. Oh, well. I am the death of me. Feed me. I&rsquo;m hungry. Let me eat all of you. Swallow you whole. You become me—we will become one. Let us become one: knowledge in all. I remember the feeling of drifting. This is it.</p><p>I am (fallen, faltered, weak, damned, sin, no, more, flesh, to, eat, grace, feed, me, all, your, flesh, damn, me, shit, me, fuck, me, grace, beauty, elegance, dance, wonder, beauty, song, grace, epitome, ever-graceful, shining, light, eyes, mighty, sign, quest, song, belief, rub, dip, die, sight, audition, lean, believe, see, no, more, flesh, try, to, hide, it, me, me, it, me) God.</p><p>Red grace is a tied-strung leaning face.

I am.</p><p>I remember seeing letters on the walls of the kindergarten classroom at NCA.</p><p>I remember watching an edited video regarding Charles Bukowski&rsquo;s philosophical statement of &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Try&rdquo;. I found this video, learning that it was the Youtube channel &ldquo;Pursuit of Wonder&rdquo; which published it on Dec 4, 2019. So it was around this time that I watched it, probably early 2020 or possibly late 2020 because often times, I come across videos that are more than 6 months old.</p><p>I remember when I used my google account nicknamed &ldquo;Canyoutalk&rdquo; for the online acting sessions with that one older dude who looked and had a bearing like Michael Jackson.</p><p>I learned that I used this same account in May 2017 to post one picture on the list of photos of Muntinlupa Church of the Nazarene. The picture was titled &ldquo;March 26, 2017, the church&rsquo;s 40th anniversary.&rdquo; It showed me a picture from the viewpoint near the end of the aisle of the church building. I posted another picture titled &ldquo;April 29, 2017, the youth having Team Building.&rdquo; This picture showed James Josh, Lorelie, me, Ate Krisha, Ardy, Leslie, JM, David, and someone else partially out of view. This picture was taken on the portico of the church building. I posted another picture titled &ldquo;Jan 27, 2017, the youth having a meeting.&rdquo; This picture showed Kuya Arnold, Kuya Glenn, my half-sister Ate Danielle, Ate Krisha, Ate Faye, Ardy, Kuya Arron, me, James Josh, JM, probalby GB, and maybe David, James Carl, or both at the back. This picture was taken on the intersecting roof between Building A and Building B. I posted another picture which I left untitled. It showed me, Kuya Glenn, my mother, and Ate Danielle. In this picture, we were standing on the stage of Muntinlupa Church of the Nazarene. I was holding my guitar from the brand &ldquo;Cort&rdquo; and Kuya Glenn was holding his guitar which had a similar color as mine. My mother was wearing a loose, white blouse, my sister was wearing a sleeveless, flowery blouse. They both wore black leggings. Kuya Glenn wore a blue graphic t-shirt and dark-blue pants. I wore skinny jeans and a white t-shirt. All of the pictures were included in my review which read: &ldquo;I have been here since I was young. This is where I learned my musical instruments. I am a part of the praise and worship team. This might not be the perfect church, but there are times I would do anything just to make it the church God wants.&rdquo; Based on what Google shows me, I posted this review &ldquo;6 years ago&rdquo; as of writing (2023-08-21 16:50:39).</p><p>I remember playing Minecraft and playing on a hardcore world on the &ldquo;Badlands&rdquo; biome. I remember using activating &ldquo;creative mode&rdquo; by turning on LAN with &ldquo;Cheats: On&rdquo;. I think I remember grabbing flowers and placing them all around on the top of a mountain. I remember using bone meal for the crops on the dirt that I brought from afar, probably from the plains or the forest biome.1</p><p>I saw a picture of me and my siblings climbing up a dark-brown sand mound at the bottom and on the side of a brown short cliff part of a hill. This hill was either roded or [studying geology, soil science, geomorphology, environmental science, natural resource management, geography, and physical geography, among others which supplement my general learning process (2023-08-21 21:56:13)]</p><p>I sometimes clamp my teeth on certain parts of the skin under my lip, and for some reason, that reduces some of the mild pain I feel when I&rsquo;m doing things like whistling for a long time. It might be because the nerves are situated there and my clamping somehow interrupts the nociceptors. It might be related to nerve interference via stimulation, the gate control theory, endorphins, distraction, or a combination of these. This has worked for me for many years, and I believe I have engaged in physical behaviors which result similarly.</p><p>I remember my Dad mentioned regarding the Y2K Problem, emphasizing that it was such a big thing since I was ignorant of it being a person born in 2003.</p><p>I notice a good example of receiving the benefits of the characteristics of pre-ideological, superficial states which mimic arrogance, strictness, fascism, and autocracy for the sake of inspiring others. A person goes and meets a group of warriors he raised since they were children, screaming and shouting that he seeks control and authority and that he is the divine king. Yet, despite his bold proclamations of godhood and majesty, he was very lenient with them, offering them support in whatever path they chose in their fighting careers. The clamorous shouting and its content served as ways to bolster them rather than necessarily being a true declaration of an oppressive hierarchical environment. This is also evident in various media such as in fictional stories, art, and music, among others.</p><p>I remember when I often saw Timothy running down the stairs and stopping in the middle of the 16-step staircase in order to watch a fight between my father and me or David.</p><p>When my father fought with David regarding his complaint regarding having to wait 10 days for something, I went downstairs and saw that Timothy&rsquo;s hair was messy when it looked neat earlier before the fight.</p><p>I remember when we first began bringing my younger brother Peter to the computer shops, I remember that we enjoyed the fact that he was there with us even if we only played Minecraft, Roblox, and Crossfire Online I think. I remember that since I, David, and our friends played League of Legends, Peter also started playing. Soon, after a few years, he became very good at the game since he was in his formative years. Even now, he still plays League of Legends.</p><p>I remember going to many high places such as condos, and I remember standing in front of a window on a high floor with my mother, half-sister, and Kuya Glenn. We might have taken a picture.</p><p>I remember seeing a group of teenage high school girls laughing in the presence of a Muslim parent and her child on the jeepney. Although their laughter could have been out of nervousness, this was the first time I witnesssed what I felt was blatant racism out of defined intention rather than cultural ignorance. It felt blatant because rather than an offhand comment which likely compared two related characteristics in a group, it felt like a direct attack toward a currently present member of of the group which they targeted. Secondly, it felt blatant because I felt that the Muslim parent and her child already had a peaceable disposition before the verbal incursion, which made the girls&rsquo; comments regarding safety issues in the presence of Muslims feel belligerent. Of course, most likely, I have heard people share common knowledge regarding different races and different major ethnolinguistic groups such as Visayans, Bicolanos, and Cebuanos. Though, that may be benign. The concept of racism still often touches upon what is considered common knowledge or stereotypical about a certain group.</p><p>I remember when I perceived &ldquo;Hershey&rsquo;s Milk Chocolate Candy Bar&rdquo;, &ldquo;Toblerone&rdquo; &ldquo;Ferrero Rocher&rdquo;, &ldquo;Cadbury Dairy Milk Chocolate&rdquo;, &ldquo;Kit Kat Chocolate&rdquo;, &ldquo;Snickers&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mars chocolate&rdquo;, &ldquo;M&amp;M&rdquo;, &ldquo;Milka&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lindt&rdquo;, &ldquo;3 Musketeers&rdquo;, &ldquo;Meiji Chocolate Almonds 88g&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dove Chocolate&rdquo;, &ldquo;Galaxy&rdquo;, &ldquo;Reese’s&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Crunch&rdquo; to be luxurious products. I think I remember that I felt that it wasintriguing that Jeremiah bought candies from a certain store rather than buying what I usually thought to be luxurious candies. Rather than concluding this fact, I expected that Jeremiah would directly associate himself with the items I expected, but he kept deviating from my expectations.</p><p>I remember when I perceived the &ldquo;Swiss Miss&rdquo; varieties to be luxurious.</p><p>I remember when I enjoyed the flat taste and mouthfeel of a carbonated soft drink when it had lost or after it lost its carbonation. I remember drinking it from a 500-milliliter &ldquo;Coca Cola&rdquo; plastic bottle. I found it to be a nice alternative from the usual
palate. I think I remember when I drank lots of this small bottle during an event or camp. I remember that this instance of drinking was enjoyably for free or as though it was for free.</p><p>I might have drunk once from a flask.</p><p>I remember when I left a restaurant or something and stood in front of the building. I remember being on a platform which comprehended ramps and &ldquo;ADA&rdquo;-abiding handrails. (ADA refers to the &ldquo;Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.&rdquo;) I remember seeing Kuya Mike vaping. I think I saw him taking out the vape from a luxurious case. I think he was wearing a black shirt. This might have been after July 23, 2017 since that was day the executive order &ldquo;Providing for the Establishment of Smoke-Free Environments in Public and Enclosed Places&rdquo; took effect. In regard to vaping, I began to notice an exponential trend in the use of vaping, especially considering that my older half-brother has been vaping for a while as of writing (2023-08-22 03:36:37).</p><p>I remember that I was interested in the large building in APNTS (Asia-Pacific Nazarene Theological Seminary) which is located in Taytay whenever I would visit the general campus during events. I think I remember having my first sparks of interest toward Bible school around that time.</p><p>I remember when I talked to Tita Maris and Jeremiah regarding Bible school in Malaysia. I remember how Tita Maris raised her eyebrows and smiled. I remember how she said regarding my mother&rsquo;s or my parents&rsquo; possible disagreement with the prospect of me going to Bible school. I remember how Jeremiah looked at me and we talked regarding his schooling at</p><p>I remember when we went on a field trip to Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.</p><p>I remember PCST (Philippine School of Tomorrow) located at Levitown Executive Village, 1711 M.J.S.Avenue, Parañaque, 1711 Kalakhang Maynila. It find it strange that it is located in Parañaque considering how separate the Parañaque Church of the Nazarene felt from PCST.</p><p>Key words: Sucat, Bicutan, EDSA. I heard it many, many times.</p><p>I remember that we would fetch my mother from Ninoy Aquino International Airport.</p><p>Vista Mall Taguig</p><p>I remember hearing that my grandmother Lola Cecille participated in the EDSA revolution which includes over a million people at the EDSA highway. I remember that her mother was there at the time of the Japanese.</p><p>I remember that I would write the names &ldquo;Manuel L. Quezon&rdquo;, &ldquo;Jose P. Laurel&rdquo;, &ldquo;Manuel A. Roxas&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sergio Osmeña&rdquo;, &ldquo;Diosdado Macapagal&rdquo;, so many times in my &ldquo;Filipino&rdquo; or &ldquo;Araling Panlipunan&rdquo; &ldquo;PACEs&rdquo; and even now the name is stuck on me. PACEs are from the School of Tomorrow.</p><p>I remember I would often read the word &ldquo;ERAP&rdquo; which refers to &ldquo;Joseph Estrada&rdquo;.</p><p>I remember hearing the name &ldquo;Noynoy Aquino&rdquo;.</p><p>Rodrigo Duterte&rsquo;s presidency really marked a very futuristic change in the way I perceived the world and life around me.</p><p>I remember when I read anti-Duterte sentiment on the side of a median strip.</p><p>I remember that when I cheated on Araling Panlipunan on my PACEs via looking at the answers at the &ldquo;scoring station&rdquo; in the classroom inside the church building at now defunct NCA, I remember that I cried to my mother while sitting on the double-deck bed with my mother. I think I remember that I was leaning against her on the bed and saying that I didn&rsquo;t cheat.</p><p>I remember that I would hear the word &ldquo;apo&rdquo; all the time whenever I would meet an older person whom my mother would often encourage me to engage in the &ldquo;mano&rdquo; gesture.</p><p>I remember when Lima, or Ama, would perform cheek-to-cheek kissing, which I found out is called &ldquo;beso-beso&rdquo;. I often thought she meant that I should kiss her on the cheek, which made it quite awkward. She was the only one who did such a thing.</p><p>I remember the scene in the webcomic &ldquo;Tower of God&rdquo; where they were fighting a big whale I think. I remember the characters flying around as they fought the whale while another set of characters were standing on a platform somewhere.</p><p>I remember the dreamy feeling of watching the movie &ldquo;Life of Pi&rdquo;.</p><p>I remember the scene in the webnovel &ldquo;Everybody Loves Large Chests&rdquo; (ELLC) where the lizard god or something died because the main character &ldquo;Boxxy&rdquo; sneakily assassinated him. When I read that scene, I remember imaging the humanoid lizard standing 6% to the right of the middle of the image, a brown weathered rusty cliffside behind him probably around 35 feet away, and a hole 1 to 1.25 larger than the lizard. This pitch-black hole led to a cave, the walls of which connected to the cliffside. I remember that the lizard was angled 30 - 45 degrees to the left and less than 5 degrees downward based on the angle of the image. Both the bare earth ground and the cliffside were yellowish-brown. I think I imaged another interpretation of the scene where the lizard was angled 90 degrees to the left and 5 - 15 degrees downward. I remember that the lizard was brownish-black in skin color and wore black clothes. I think I remember him having spikes along its head and possibly its back. I remember that the lizard held a weapon of some sort.</p><p>The details mentioned in these two imaginary images were visual details which I only produced in writing now. Many of my memories have such embedded visual details which I want to delineate, and I hope to continue detailing my memories for maximally specific documentation.</p><p>I remember another scene in ELLC where a woman was walking around and then another woman. I think the other woman had a pet dragon or something.</p><p>I remember when my sister and I went to a Fujifilm seminar of some sort. I think she used the &ldquo;X100F&rdquo; \parencite{x100f}(or maybe X100T) model.</p><p>The sound- and ocular-insulation of my room provided a buffer in regard to the tensions which arose from the antagonisms between I and my father&rsquo;s philosophies, ideals, and personalities. In addition, direct, continuous access to a computer, the Internet, music, and a guitar were primary buffers, among others.</p><p>August 22, 2023, 17:32</p><p>I remember when the youth from my former main church would play volleyball in the basketball court of Agro Homes Subd. I remember when they would bring down the volleyball net and when they would pull the poles which tires interconnected to them weighed down.</p><p>I remember an older woman with a Parkinsonian gait going to church and back. She would walk the whole way. I think I remember hearing that her son was the kind who would leave her be \parencite{OGUZ2010200}.</p><p>I remember when we had ducks as pets. I remember seeing them pooping in the bathroom. I remember placing my hand on them and petting them. I remember that they were yellow and black. I remember their smell and their quacks. I remember the feeling of seeing them in the bathroom with the light turned on. I remember that we gave either one or both away to “Nanay Nanding” or something. However, Nanay cooked the ducks after rats killed them I think. Or maybe, one of them got cooked, and rats killed the other one.</p><p>I remember that since Agro Homes Subd. was uphill sloped upward the deeper I went, when going downhill, I often swung my arms more forward since that is where the center of equilibrium sits. I remember seeing Jeilla especially with her very characteristic gait in regard to the sloping nature of the village.</p><p>I rememer when &ldquo;Sir RR&rdquo;, my couch, asked whether I knew a certain person from Agro Homes Subd.</p><p>I remember when I and my classmates had a special field trip at Jamboree Lake for those who performed well in my grade in MCA.</p><p>I remember when the girlfriend of my coach texted me using my coach&rsquo;s phone number cancelling a coaching workshop session.</p><p>Dehydration, Sinus Issues, Eye Strain, Tension Headaches</p><p>I remember when I would watch TV news for a period of time probably in Lola Cecille&rsquo;s house.</p><p>I remember when the kitchen area of Building B of my former main church used to have a TV. I think I remember seeing the woman who got a stroke being there.</p><p>This woman used to be so lively. But now they can&rsquo;t even talk or walk as much. It&rsquo;s so sad because the friends they used to have have now separated due to a conflict some time later. I hope they&rsquo;re doing fine.</p><p>I remember when I played in a Minecraft server. I remember traveling for many, many &ldquo;blocks&rdquo; and discovering that many places had restrictions placed so that only the owner could break blocks. I remember this one big place which had &ldquo;Librarian Villagers&rdquo;. I remember discovering that I could break some parts of the restrictive land, but it was mostly blocks outside of the actual flooring and buildings of the place.</p><p>I remember another server, or probably the same one, where I remember building a lot in a Minecraft server. I remember that a boy designated this lot to me. I think I remember chatting with him and then realizing that maybe the fact that my Minecraft &ldquo;skin&rdquo; was that of a girl influenced the behavior of that boy. I remember spending some time and building stairs with wood. I think I remember venturing out of the community to find wood and mine. I remember that the server was kind of laggy since sometimes, the loading of the blocks were slow or they halted midway or something.</p><p>I think I remember playing the Roblox game &ldquo;{\twemoji{crossed swords}} SKYWARS {\twemoji{bow and arrow}}&rdquo; once.</p><p>I remember playing with many people over the years in League of Legends. I remember a certain player who played the champion &ldquo;Sylas&rdquo; and another player who played &ldquo;ADRs&rdquo; like the champions &ldquo;Samira&rdquo;, &ldquo;Vayne&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Kaysa&rdquo;. I played many games with this latter player as the champion &ldquo;Nami&rdquo;. I remember sharing my Facebook link since he asked or something, but then he was silent afterward. I think he thought that I was a girl, but my brain was just thinking that it was nice to have someone with whom to play. I was able to get to the rank &ldquo;Diamond IV&rdquo; by playing alongside him. I think this was during the time when rank stages started at &ldquo;V&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;IV&rdquo;. I remember that our first game was so good and satisfying since I remember getting a high KDA (Kills to Deaths to Assists) with Nami. I think I got probably over 15 kills, maybe even over 20. I remember playing very quickly in that game and surprising that ADR player and the rest of the players. I think I remember specifically killing the enemy &ldquo;carry&rdquo; in the bush or bursh between the first &ldquo;Red Side&rdquo; bottom lane turret and the &ldquo;jungle&rdquo; monster &ldquo;Gromp,&rdquo; which I think was the most heightened moment of one of the many games wherein I excelled and played well.</p><p>I remember playing many champions over the course of my League of Legends journey. I started playing since the game&rsquo;s graphics were old. I played with those graphics for a long, long time. I remember playing with very old items, so I was probably there at the start.</p><p>I remember when I began hearing my mother talking about the use of plastic and paper bags especially in relation to the ordinance \parencite{ordinance2010}. I remember when Savemore still used plastic bags.</p><p>mysinglelifesamyui.wordpress.com</p><p>instagram.com/samueljoshuape</p><p>Samuel Joshua Pe on Youtube.</p><p>The fact that I forgot that I deleted my accounts really adds up to the suspense and excitement in trying to remember my past and the disappointment in realizing that some stuff was lost forever: data from the IPhone 4 that my father used, among others.</p><p>The main character &ldquo;Dora&rdquo; from &ldquo;Dora the Explorer&rdquo; looks otherworldly now compared to how I saw her in the past. It is strange how children tend to accept things as they are. This thought made me think about the webcomic I made on Webtoons since I just looked at it a while ago after I wanted to look at the history of webcomics I&rsquo;ve read on my two accounts &ldquo;yoksikan&rdquo; and &ldquo;samyui&rdquo;. This thought led to me wanting to draw my webcomic again or make a new webcomic. Then, I realized that my computer had little space and that I was going to have to keep uploading my files to &ldquo;Google Drives&rdquo; since I made a rule to use the &ldquo;Recorder Docker&rdquo; of Krita, which too up a lot of space.</p><p>I remember that when I checked my other Garena account &ldquo;samuel9yr&rdquo;, I discovered that the &ldquo;IGN&rdquo; (In-game name), which is distinct from my username &ldquo;samuel9yr&rdquo;, changed to &ldquo;changename67&rdquo; or something like that. This name inspired the name change of my Royalroad account &ldquo;Samuel Joshua Pe&rdquo; to &ldquo;changename67&rdquo;.</p><p>I remember that in the hotel during National Student Convention, I remember my higher-grade classmates running up and down the staircase of the hotel. I think I might have climbed down the staircase once, but I believe I used the elevator for the most part. I think I remember standing behind Robyn Shadrach.</p><p>I remember sitting down at the table for long periods of time at the cottage in Baguio. I remember drinking two or more bottles of a cheap strawberry wine. I remember waiting for my mother and company, which includes my half-sister, John Joshua Ferrancol and Ann, to come back, but I did remember going with my mother and company to the photographic shooting of products for a client. I remember the fireplace of the cottage. I remember the congested environment of the establishment wherein the client led us to the rooftop. I remember the bathrooms wherein I stared past the door which lay right before the bathroom. I remember the spiral road which led downhill to the road in front of Baguio Country Club. I remember where I expected the fireplace to be; however, what lay there was only the structure of the fireplace rather than with the wood and the fire. I remember staying in a large room with two beds opposite to one another and situated next to the walls and at the middle. I think I remember that I might have eaten bread once my mother and company returned. I think I might have eaten chicken at the dinner table at the cottage. I remember that I and my half-sister connected to a wall socket there. I remember the heavy-set entrance door. I remember the walk down the hill outside the cottage. I remember the curvilinear, side-to-side steps as I extracted myself from the ground and embedded myself back like a</p><p>It&rsquo;s a short life in ignorance, but the view is quite spectacular.</p><p>I remember this guard whom I often said &ldquo;Good Morning&rdquo; to and got the same response. I remember when I randomly stopped out of nowhere probably because he stopped responding as strongly. I remember wearing a strong blue shirt which depicting the words &ldquo;FORGED IN GOLD&rdquo;. I think I got shirt from either Ama or Tita Maris. I think I was going to New Life Church around that time, wearing that blue shirt.</p><p>I remember the various shirts I got from Jeremiah and then took because I borrowed it and brought it home because they allowed me since I remember that I sometimes brought too little clothes for sleepovers.</p><p>I remember when I masturbate using Jeremiah&rsquo;s pillow when I was at his old house in the bedroom where we slept. I remember that this same bedroom became used by Tita Maris. We moved around a lot in terms of where we slept. I remember when we slept in the room where I remember Kuya Mike slept. I remember that Jeremiah got some of the futons and unrolled it. I think Tita Maris gave it to us at that time, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure Jeremiah either got it from inside the room or, less likely, from outside.</p><p>I remember when I told Jeremiah that Kuya Mike was looking at his abs in the mirror because he was &ldquo;insecure&rdquo;. Jeremiah laughed, but his tone sounded complex and hard to pinpoint where one emotion started and ended whether this emotion was there in the first place. I think I remember that we were in the living room of his new house.</p><p>I remember that I would often use my hands to climb the stairs here at home when I was younger. I still do it from time to time.</p><p>I remember this Shorts or Tiktok video about a Californian woman talking about cheap bread or something. Then, the comments mocked her saying that the bread was still very expensive and that if she wanted something cheap, she could live elsewhere.</p><p>I remember that I periodically go a day or two wearing the same shorts (or pants even) because the clothes are either still wet or my mother is outside.</p><p>I spent over an hour searching for something to fap to. However, in the process, I got to assess what I liked and disliked and see how my preferences compare with those that are popular as well as get a feel for what kind of people read certain things by looking at what gets popular and what it&rsquo;s about.</p><p>I remember that I noticed the similarity in appearance between a certain stocky character with a skull-life face or mask from Miragine War and the main character &ldquo;Ainz Ooal Gown&rdquo; from the anime &ldquo;Overlord.&rdquo;</p><p>My face gets flaky, and I think it began when I started staying in the room with Peter who often turned on the aircon since we were both in the room and I preferred having the windows closed. The aircon most likely made the skin of my face dry, causing my face to be flaky.</p><p>Whenever I sleep on my belly with my face against the pillow, when I wake up, rarely, my face becomes numb to the point that it feels like sickness. However, I can easily solve this problem by doing facial exercises while avoiding wrinkling my forehead and take a shower if or once I feel warm enough. I also remember that if my hair felt hot, taking a shower with somewhat cold water helped me cool down and homegenize my body temperature. Facial products such as moisturizers and sensitive skin-respecting soap helps remove the numbness as well.</p><p>I remember that David would often call out my mother&rsquo;s name when he was sleeping and probably right before he was about to wake up. I remember that David often used computer half-naked just like Kuya Paulo.</p><p>I remember that Kuya Paulo would often wear a sleeveless t-shirt.</p><p>I remember that from inside, I would often see bikes zooming by the front of our house.</p><p>I probably wrote so many things on my father&rsquo;s iPhone 4 and my mother&rsquo;s old Vaio laptop.</p><p>I think I remember texting someone using the Phone&rsquo;s text messenger.</p><p>These are very powerful memories since I forgot them. I must have had such a profound experience with using my Dad&rsquo;s phone.</p><p>I think I remember that it was rare that I watched porn om that IPhone.</p><p>I might have read the webcomic about the The Brilliant Village Doctor in that IPhone.</p><p>I think I remember that Tita Rhoda was in the dream wherein I went to a mall and met the dude whom I thought seemed autistic. This was also the same dream where I saw Ardy sitting down.</p><p>I remember that in this dream, when I was at the sidewalk, the side of the mall was like a giant wall. I remember gray pathways and grass and trees I think.</p><p>I remember that I had a dream a long time ago where I saw Ryan Higa outside near a bus probably and greeting fans.</p><p>I remember that when we were either heading or going back from the computer shop, that girl who was friends with Jeremiah and I were walking on the street. We probably bought some food from a nearby convenience store.</p><p>I remember the country club place at Jeremiah&rsquo;s old house.</p><p>I remember how I and Peter argued with our mother regarding going to the beach and preferred to stay home. However, my mother was stonefaced and obstinate. We were in my room, and my mother was sitting on the floor. I think Kuya Paulo was peeking from the door.</p><p>I remember that all I did was lie down on that beach.</p><p>I remember when I and the youth were crossing the pedestrian lane outside Paranaque United Hills Church of the Nazarene. I remember that Kuya James (&ldquo;Jame Jame&rdquo; on Facebook) led us out and waved farewell</p><p>I remember the many lucky badminton response shots I got. It was so satisfying to chase the shuttlecock. I remember that feeling of wanting to go to the bathroom and then discovering that there was a bathroom. Even now, I wonder how the place even got so much space and size since it felt like a very abandoned place. I remember playing often with Timothy and Peter. I remember the feeling of being exhausted and staring at the ground. Sometimes, I would just sit down on the rubber badminton court. However, I remember that there was a seating. I remember sitting there alongside bags and water bottles. I remember James Carl I think sitting down and probably browsing his phone. Kuya Glenn, Ate Danielle, probably Ate Krishna, and Ate Desiree. I think Ate Faye also came rarely, and I might have been disappointed when it was only Ate Faye rather than her and Ardy.</p><p>I remember seeing the numerous badminton tournaments based on the vinyl posters hanging on ropes and swinging back and forth with the wind.</p><p>I remember when the basketball court of Agro Homes Subd was open rather than fenced.</p><p>I remember when I crossed the road from</p><p>I remember when I realized I forgot to bring my money when I was already half-way in the jeepney ride. I remember that the jeepney driver made me swear in God&rsquo;s name regarding my claim. I was being honest, and I was very worried. I think the driver let me go all the way since I was already half-way through the journey, and then I got down, feeling ashamed.</p><p>I remember when the house further up Canary St. sold the ice drink &ldquo;Iskrambol&rdquo;, or &ldquo;scramble.&rdquo; I remember when the sari-sari store in Rainbow Rd., which is the middle road of Agro Homes Subd, sold fish ball and kikiam at one point.</p><p>I think I remember in the hotel room With Aidan, Robyn, Juan, Andrei, and Neo Bregente during NSC where I was worried that our noise would bother the people in the next hotel room.</p><p>I think I remember that before we were about to leave, either Juan, Neo, or one of the other much higher–grades reporting that we had to leave or they were leaving us here.</p><p>I think we got on but on another vehicle. I remember hoping that we would make up, but when we got there, I learned that Aidan lost his chance at getting a medal.</p><p>I remember the scene where two armies clashed either in the anime &ldquo;The Genius Prince&rsquo;s Guide To Raising a Nation Out of Debt&rdquo; or &ldquo;How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom&rdquo;.</p><p>I remember reading the lightnovel &ldquo;Starting From Today I’ll Work As A City Lord&rdquo; a little bit.</p><p>I remember that I would often refill the water, but I find it strange that every else in the family avoided it. It made sense since I&rsquo;m used to carrying cups and heavy objects due to the many outdoor events and activities which required it. We refill water by putting it in cups which we place inside the refrigerator for cooling rather than storing a large pitcher and then pouring water into empty cups. I remember getting culture shock in Jeremiah&rsquo;s older house. I remember eating at the dinner table and asking for the pitcher. However, family dinnertime at Jeremiah&rsquo;s house might have been rare.</p><p>I remember when my cousin Jeremiah petted me on the head while we were hanging out with that dude, who I think was the son of a maid and who looked slender and had a graceful bearing.</p><p>I remember that I considered that he seemed feminine in appearance and behavior in an inherent manner rather imitating stereotypical behavior in social media, which was the first I have seen in my life at that time I think.</p><p>I remember that dude who lived on the opposite side of Canary St. a little further up. He wore glasses, brought a briefcase or a laptop bag, and looked like he worked ass a software developer. I think I heard he was. His house had a Doberman I believe.</p><p>I remember the older man whom I asked as part of a group regarding Jesus and who rejected me.</p><p>I remember going into a hospital as part of a group for a Baguio conference or event or something and praying for several sick people there.</p><p>I remember when I used Snapchat with Jeremiah while hanging out in his older house.</p><p>I remember watching almost all of Nigahiga&rsquo;s videos.</p><p>I remember reading the &ldquo;The Iron Teeth: A Goblin&rsquo;s Tale&rdquo; and enjoying that scene wherein the main character hangs out with some other goblins. I remember that he soon became the hobgoblin by transformation and beat the hobgoblin who led the goblins.</p><p>I remember watching that video which included a mob boss saying some inspirational things. It was probably a YouTube short rather a video. From the comments of that video, I learned that the mob boss was only an actor pretending to be a mob boss.</p><p>I remember numerous videos of the Youtube channel &ldquo;Jubilee&rdquo;. I remember seeing Youtubers such as Pewdiepie, XQC, and probably Ludwig watch them.</p><p>I remember seeing hundreds of Youtube videos about travel. Many categories exist regarding the various perspectives and styles of presentations these videos comprehend. One of these categories includes the silent or mostly silent narrator, the first-person view, and the raw footage. Another one includes only drone shots and typically piano or orchestral music. A third category includes video logging wherein the narrator points their camera onto their face for the most part. Standard practice would most likely include drone shots or time lapses for transitions between scenes. In addition to categories for travel videos, the categories of the comment sections of these videos would be good to study.</p><p>I remember when those two good-looking girls looked like they were looking in my direction. I heard them talking to one another, possibly giggling or whispering, and maybe they might have taken a picture of me. However, I might be wrong. This was in Bonifacio Global City in Burgos Park.</p><p>The National Prayer Gatherings was instrumental to bringing some level of national consciousness into me.</p><p>I remember that my younger brother Peter had a propensity for digital privacy. He introduced me to various desktop applications such as the password manager &ldquo;KeyPass&rdquo;, the virtual private network (VPN) &ldquo;ProtonVPN&rdquo;, the rest of the Proton services or products such as the email service &ldquo;Protonmail&rdquo;, the installable catalogue of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) &ldquo;Android&rdquo; applications &ldquo;F-Droid&rdquo;, the FOSS alternative Google Play Store frontend client &ldquo;Aurora Store&rdquo;, the two-factor authentication (2FA) app &ldquo;Authy&rdquo;, probably the 2FA app &ldquo;Aegis&rdquo;, the FOSS note-taking app &ldquo;Joplin&rdquo;, and probably the mod version of the official Youtube mobile app &ldquo;Youtube Vanced&rdquo;, among others.</p><p>It is usual that people forget the full name of acronyms such as VPN and sufficiently understand the acronyms by their meanings and purposes.</p><p>I remember that Jeremiah introduced the manga &ldquo;My Perfect Girlfriend!&rdquo; to me around the time he introduced &ldquo;Tachiyomi&rdquo; to me. I think Domestic Girlfriend was one of the first &ldquo;18+&rdquo; manga I have read. I remember a time before I read hentai manga and only watched hentai anime.</p><p>I remember searching several storage solutions from very professional companies intended for bulk. I remember finding it strange that Amazon had little in the way of storage racks and it felt like a minority concern.</p><p>I remember when Jeremiah bought the Cherry soft drink in bulk.</p><p>I remember when I and my family bought the soft drink &ldquo;Ginger Ale&rdquo; in bulk (probably 16 pcs.) at &ldquo;SNR Membership Shopping&rdquo; because it was cheaper after its previous owner returned it due to small damage.</p><p>I am surprised to learn that SNR is Philippine-owned rather than foreign and that &ldquo;Puregold&rdquo; owns it. However, the American financial services company &ldquo;Capital Group&rdquo; owns Puregold.</p><p>\subsection*{August 23, 2023, 11:48 PM}</p><p>I remember when I built a house in the Minecraft Twitch Viewer SMP I made as the livestreamer and then learned that someone burned it. I remember just doing my best and just rebuilding it. I can remember how the building looked like too. It was a square structure probably measuring 17x18 blocks in width and length and probably 10 - 25 blocks in height on the ground floor and probably 15 - 25 in height, width, and length in the B1 floor. The B1 floor contained a cuboid storage room full of barrels for storage. I remember that I used a ladder at first and then changed to a water shoot for vertical transportation. This water shoot had signs to prevent spillage into air blocks, an impossible feat in reality. I remember that I first paved the B1 ground with a shovel and then removed them in order to make room for wooden slabs I think. I chose these slabs since they were much cheaper for the same function that full wooden blocks, also known as &ldquo;Planks&rdquo;, offered. I remember that one or several of the barrels contained torches, coal, and probably iron ore and iron ingots. I remember that I paved paths toward various players&rsquo; buildings with wooden, stone, and probably iron shovels all around the village. I remember building a bridge across a shallow one- to two-block lake. I think I remember someone building a small shop at the village center. This was the same server where someone with a username close to &ldquo;John Panda&rdquo; built a skull structure. I remember that the player &ldquo;Sprutnutt&rdquo; built his house behind the skull and that the mob farm was very close by. I think that this server was the second one. I remember that we had to reset the server for a third time. This third server was when the &ldquo;trolls&rdquo; came into the server and people started living far away from each other to avoid PVP -(Player versus Player) encounters since I think the second and first server was in &ldquo;Peaceful Mode.&rdquo; Though, I think that I turned the PVP off after it became annoying for players. In the end, the trolling persisted and made it so that even if it was in Peaceful Mode, it was difficult. I tried so hard to abide by a lenient moderator code to the point that even if the trolls were pouring lava, making those solid &ldquo;cobblestone waves&rdquo; by mixing lava and water, and standing in front of me for hours over the course of about a week to prevent me from mining in front of me because it was in Peaceful Mode, I still went against banning him since the constitution of my server allowed &ldquo;practical&rdquo; trolling as long as it adhered to inclusivity in other areas such as race and gender and avoided being toxic in chat. Nevertheless, it was a stressful environment which burned me out many times toward the latter portion of my 2-month Minecraft streaming. It was a success as a foray into the various mechanics implicated in socio-cultural dissemination within a cyber virtual environment which enforces the manifestation of roles and personalities given the limited and almost always rounding, interiorizing mechanism which Minecraft imposes in regard to that online persona and thus impinges upon the comprehensiveness which any interactions which arise convey. Maybe, that constitutional ideal could have been plausible under different circumstances such as that which comprehends a more established methodology concerning the management of practical trolls while abiding by that leniency within the constitution and which comprehends more effective modalities in which I could intercept the concerns of players while engaging with them as a hands-on participant within the server. Indeed, a larger moderator base and more established brand identity could solve the problem, but at that point, it would have lost the more one-to-one connection which a smaller server offered.</p><p>I remember the various shoes we bought. I think I remember buying the shoes I used for MCA. I remember buying white shoes from the shoe store &ldquo;World Balance&rdquo;. I remember buying the hiking shoes, which had a coating of a blend of green, brown, and yellow, from the shoe store &ldquo;Merrell&rdquo;.</p><p>I remember when JM would raise his hand as if to go for a high-five but then he would put his hand around his head. I saw this gesture from a Korean film, so JM might have seen it from a Korean film.</p><p>I got annoyed whenever my father would comment regarding how realistic the films we were watching were. It has been like that for years to the point that my older half-brother David started echoing the similar disposition toward films. It is so funny that my father and David clash when they both hold the same philosophy of cynicism. That was a redundant question: a figure of speech. Even if two people hold similar ideas, cynicism makes it so that even if you have so much in common, that annoyed, proud-to-be-paranoid, argumentative smirk still stays on those lips. I am against systematic abuse, but any person with that know-it-all, smart-ass tone needs to realize that if he wants to be heard, it is so much better if you truly want to be listened to rather than just treating people condescendingly and blaming others for everything. I am argumentative when I am against cynicism because I believe that cynicism pretends to be a solution when all it is is just that dude complaining randomly and messily all the time when they can be acting out and voicing out their complaints while pondering effectiveness and changing methods if needed. I may act like a know-it-all, but I hope that you see me act that way when arguing against cynicism because I want to communicate that I am serious about cynicism being a disease. Cynicism is different from anxiety disorder and depression disorder. I am talking about that lifestyle, the philosophy which dictates their decision-making and the content of their speeches. If only they organized their thoughts rather than spilling their concerns in that declarative, obstinate way bereft of details and giving reasons and backgrounds for their ideas and full of insults, curses, and name-calling which only serve as a &ldquo;whose toy car is bigger&rdquo; competition rather than anything relative to what is being argued, then maybe it would be easier to listen to them, even people with whom I agree.</p><p>I feel that I am drifting. The thoughts of my past coming back to me. I can remember so many worlds that I have read: books and webcomics coming back to me. I remember the world of the webnovel &ldquo;Worm&rdquo;. I remember the steampunk world of the webnovel &ldquo;The Lord of the Mysteries&rdquo; and every other media set in a steampunk setting. I remember the numerous times I felt that I could stay trapped in those worlds when I was there. I remember the world of the webnovel &ldquo;Reverend Insanity&rdquo;. I remember the webnovel &ldquo;Overgeared&rdquo;. I remember the webnovel &ldquo;The Legendary Mechanic&rdquo;. These legendary novels contributed to my comprehension of various different worlds, yet I dropped all of them. It was too much to know that such a world was fake and could end. A world only feels real when you love it and hate it so much that there are times when you wish it could end but, ultimately, that I want it to go on forever. I remember the webnovel &ldquo;The Iron Teeth: A Goblin&rsquo;s Tale&rdquo;. I remember the webnovel &ldquo;Chrysalis&rdquo;. I remember the webnovel &ldquo;Everybody Loves Large Chests&rdquo;. I forgot so many webnovels because &ldquo;Google History&rdquo; failed to capture them. The only novels I remember are few, and the rest of the novels are those in my &ldquo;Royalroad History&rdquo;.</p><p>I think I remember that we got &ldquo;Timmy&rdquo;, Jeremiah&rsquo;s nephew, from a child care center.</p><p>I remember when I was writing down &ldquo;2013&rdquo; on a &ldquo;goal chart&rdquo; in NCA. I remember thinking hard to find out which numbers referred to what months. I remember writing the wrong date several times and needed a corrector. I think I got a corrector from Clarence a lot.</p><p>I remember that I and my siblings would say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; as a tentative, tacit way to say that we want something that is beyond our ownership, especially food. It is normal to say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; as one is about to eat, so saying &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; before one has food indicates our desire to have that food given to us so that we may say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; maturely.</p><p>\begin{tikzpicture}[

Visually, the environment of these older men is detailed. Firstly, they sat on &ldquo;Cofta,&rdquo; old, plastic, chipped chairs and stools. Also, these chairs often had a taped-on leg and a broken backrest. Secondly, they were positioned outside in front of the portico or porch of their cement home. Moreover, these houses would be lined up together with probably a 1 to 5 meters gaps of bare earth and probably tiny patches of vegetation. Thirdly, the ground was littered with limestone gravel. Additionally, these older men were usually be bald and only have silver hair at the sides of the back of their head. In other cases, they wore hats and skinny jeans especially if they came home from work. Maybe, one of them left a motorcycle helmet nearby atop a balustrade. Fourth, in a more urban setting, seeing the co-occurrence of &ldquo;sari-sari&rdquo; stores and generally older men playing cards is common. Lastly, it is usual to find a motorcycle, a tricycle, or, less usual, a jeepney parked close by. Among the smells, I could identity the very faint smells of soap, shampoo, and lavender from detergent, softener, or conditioner on my fresh shirt. Specifically, these were so faint that it changes the mood while avoiding detection until I lifted up their nose to maximize the size of their nostrils and breathed hard successively or pressed their nose against the source of the smell and sniffed roughly. (as of writing before the time 2023-08-25 09:18:08)</p><p>My mother mentioned several times that she knew the smell of cigarettes, and I remember her correcting me once regarding my mistake that a certain scent smelled like cigarettes.</p><p>I remember seeing probably above 7 cat bodies on the street or side of the street of Agro Homes throughout my lifetime as of writing (2023-08-25 09:14:03). I remember seeing the body of a kitten in front of the door. I think I heard that it was likely a rat who killed it. I remember the many rats and mices who stepped onto the sticky mouse traps my mother used to lay on the floor right behind the refrigerator and behind the door leading to the dishwashing area where the washing machine and former primary shoe rack used to be. I remember the rat who died to the cat recently. I think I have seen several dead rats that the cats which had flocked to our house killed. I remember the numerous cats that went to us and stayed. I remember &ldquo;Mingming&rdquo;, the mother of many cats and her son &ldquo;One-eyed&rdquo;, among many other cats. I remember that one of Mingming&rsquo;s children died to the car. Every time I saw a cat die, it was this reminder of mortality like listening to the Youtube video &ldquo;Breaking Bad OST 17/20 - &ldquo;Crawl Space&rdquo; Music [Dave Porter] [HQ/HD]&rdquo;.
